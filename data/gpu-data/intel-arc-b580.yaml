summary: |
  The Intel Arc B580 is a discrete graphics card launched in December 2024, featuring Intel's second-generation
  Xe2-HPG (Battlemage) architecture on the BMG-G21 silicon. Built on TSMC's 5nm process with 19.6 billion transistors
  on a 272mm² die, the card features 20 Xe-cores (2,560 shading units), 160 XMX (Xe Matrix Extension) engines for
  AI acceleration, and 20 ray tracing units. It includes 12GB of GDDR6 memory on a 192-bit bus running at 19 Gbps,
  delivering 456 GB/s of memory bandwidth. The B580 offers 13.67 TFLOPS of FP32 performance and 233 TOPS of INT8
  performance through its XMX engines, which support FP16, BF16, INT8, and INT4 precision formats for AI/ML
  workloads. With a TDP of 190W and positioned at a $249 launch price, the Arc B580 represents Intel's competitive
  entry into the mainstream discrete GPU market, offering strong AI acceleration capabilities through XMX engines
  and improved architectural efficiency over the previous Alchemist generation. The architecture features enhanced
  vector engines with SIMD16/SIMD32 support, 256KB L1 cache per Xe-core, and 18MB shared L2 cache. Notable features
  include support for DirectX 12 Ultimate, Vulkan 1.4, PCIe 4.0 x8, and Intel's XeSS upscaling technology powered
  by the XMX AI accelerators.
