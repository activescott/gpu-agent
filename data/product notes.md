Target Audience: Software engineers, data scientists, and SREs interested in machine learning.

Key Features:

- Performance statistics are from rigorous MLPerf benchmarks for all of the GPUs and AI accelerators popular in machine learning.
- Performance statistics for GPUs and AI accelerators are all collected into one place.
- Every product listing has a breakdown of it's price by performance metrics that are crucial to AI model training and inference - allowing you to decide based on price-performance ratios rather than making arbitrary buy decisions
- Every product listing is available for purchase now. We don't show back-ordered or other products that cannot be ordered right now.

Unique Selling Points (USPs): There is no other place we're aware of that collects such detailed hardware performance metrics from AI training and inference benchmarks and breaks down the price by those metrics. This only way to know if you're getting the performance that you pay for. You could always do this work in a spreadsheet, but collecting the various cards and their performance metrics, along with the available places to purchase the cards is a significant undertaking. We bring it all together in one place so you don't have to spend the time. We also can offer this entirely for free based on affiliate fees - we get a small fee for each time you buy something by clicking on our site.

Tone and Style: It should be energetic and persuasive, but also professional to garner credibility. We don't want to be perceived as spam or phishing of some kind.

Call to Action (CTA): Come to our site and just look at the surprising performance metrics of every GPU and AI Accelerator on the market - and if you're interested, you can buy one right now too!
