          This site provides a listing of available GPUs and machine-learning
          accelerators that support model training and model inference. Each
          listing provides a set of statistics based on industry benchmarks
          related to the accelerator card's performance for machine learning
          compared to it's price. So you always can buy a price based on is cost
