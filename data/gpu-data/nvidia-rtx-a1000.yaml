summary: |
  The NVIDIA RTX A1000 is an entry-level professional workstation GPU released on April 16, 2024,
  built on the Ampere architecture using the GA107 chip with 8nm process technology. It features
  2,304 CUDA cores, 72 third-generation Tensor Cores, and 18 second-generation RT Cores, paired
  with 8GB of GDDR6 memory. The third-generation Tensor Cores deliver 53.8 TFLOPS of FP16
  performance with sparsity and 107.8 TOPS of INT8 performance with sparsity, making it capable
  of handling AI-augmented workflows including AI denoising and DLSS. With a remarkably low TDP
  of only 50W and a single-slot, low-profile form factor, the card requires no auxiliary power
  connector and is designed for compact workstations where space and power are constrained.
  Memory bandwidth of 192 GB/s is provided through a 128-bit memory interface. The GPU features
  PCI Express 4.0 x8 interface and four Mini DisplayPort 1.4a outputs, supporting up to four
  5K displays simultaneously.

notes:
  - FP32 TFLOPS of 6.74 sourced from NVIDIA official product page and Lenovo Press documentation.
  - FP16 TFLOPS of 53.8 represents peak tensor performance with sparsity from NVIDIA product page.
  - INT8 TOPS of 107.8 calculated as approximately double FP16 tensor performance (53.8 × 2).
  - Memory bandwidth calculated as 128-bit × 12 Gbps ÷ 8 = 192 GB/s.
  - CUDA Compute Capability 8.6 confirmed for GA107 Ampere chip.
  - The GPU uses the GA107 chip with 2,304 of 3,072 possible CUDA cores enabled.
  - TDP is 50W, no auxiliary power connector required.
  - Released April 16, 2024, filling the entry-level workstation gap with RT and tensor capabilities.
  - MSRP of $365 USD from NVIDIA marketplace listing.
