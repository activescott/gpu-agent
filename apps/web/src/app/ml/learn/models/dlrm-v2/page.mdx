## About Machine Learning Model DLRM

Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM) is a neural network-based model designed for personalization and recommendation systems. Developed by a team from Facebook, DLRM was introduced to address the unique challenges of handling categorical features in recommendation models. Unlike traditional deep learning networks, DLRM processes categorical data through embeddings and dense features using a multilayer perceptron (MLP). This design is instrumental in tasks like ad click-through rate prediction and rankings in large internet companies. The model was introduced with an open-source implementation in both PyTorch and Caffe2 frameworks and includes a specialized parallelization scheme for optimizing memory usage and computational efficiency.
