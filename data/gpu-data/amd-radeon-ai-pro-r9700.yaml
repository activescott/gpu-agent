summary: |
  The AMD Radeon AI PRO R9700 is a professional AI workstation GPU released on July 23, 2025,
  built on AMD's RDNA 4 architecture using the Navi 48 GPU die manufactured on TSMC's 4nm process.
  Featuring 64 compute units with 4,096 stream processors and 128 second-generation AI Accelerators,
  the card is designed for local AI inference, model fine-tuning, and complex creative workloads.
  It includes 32GB of high-speed GDDR6 memory on a 256-bit interface running at 20 Gbps, delivering
  640 GB/s of memory bandwidth. The GPU delivers 47.8 TFLOPS of FP32 vector performance and
  95.7 TFLOPS of FP16 vector performance, with clock speeds ranging from 1,620 MHz base to 2,920 MHz
  boost (game clock of 2,350 MHz). The 2nd-generation AI Accelerators deliver 191 TFLOPS FP16 matrix,
  383 TOPS INT8 matrix, and 766 TOPS INT4 matrix (dense), with structured sparsity doubling throughput
  to 383 TFLOPS FP16, 766 TOPS INT8, and 1,531 TOPS INT4. The card features a compact dual-slot design with
  a blower-style cooling solution and a 300W TDP, using PCIe 5.0 connectivity for maximum bandwidth.
  AMD positions this as their flagship AI workstation GPU, fully compatible with the ROCm open software
  platform with support for PyTorch, ONNX Runtime, and TensorFlow frameworks. Display connectivity
  includes four DisplayPort 2.1 outputs. Available initially in SI-built workstation systems from
  Boxx and Velocity Micro, with standalone cards from ASRock, ASUS, Gigabyte, PowerColor, Sapphire,
  XFX, and Yeston available later in Q3 2025. Priced at $1,299 USD, it targets AI developers, data
  scientists, and creative professionals who need substantial local AI inference capability.

notes:
  - MSRP of $1,299 USD sourced from AMD official blog post and retail listings. Available July 23, 2025 in SI-built systems, with standalone cards from board partners available later in Q3 2025.
  - FP32 TFLOPS of 47.8 calculated as 4,096 stream processors × 2,920 MHz boost clock × 4 ops/cycle (dual-issue) ÷ 1,000,000 = 47.8 TFLOPS. RDNA 4 architecture features dual-issue FP32 capability, effectively doubling shader throughput compared to single-issue designs.
  - FP16 TFLOPS of 95.7 is the peak FP16 vector (shader) performance per the AMD official datasheet (radeon-ai-pro-r9700-datasheet.pdf). FP16 matrix performance via AI Accelerators is 191 TFLOPS dense, 383 TFLOPS with structured sparsity.
  - INT8 TOPS of 383 is the peak INT8 matrix (dense) performance per the AMD official datasheet. With structured sparsity, INT8 reaches 766 TOPS. INT4 matrix is 766 TOPS dense, 1,531 TOPS sparse. FP8 matrix is 383 TFLOPS dense, 766 TFLOPS sparse.
  - tensorCoreCount of 128 represents the 2nd-generation AI Accelerators (2 per compute unit × 64 compute units), which are AMD's dedicated matrix multiplication units for AI workloads.
  - Memory bandwidth calculated as 256-bit interface × 20 Gbps ÷ 8 bits/byte = 640 GB/s, confirmed by AMD specifications.
  - RDNA 4 architecture includes redesigned 3rd-generation Ray Tracing Accelerators and 2nd-generation AI Accelerators with support for sparsity acceleration.
  - Supported hardware operations include FP8, FP16, BF16, INT8, and INT4 on AI Accelerators, with FP32 operations on general shader units. Sparsity acceleration enables up to 4× FP16 and 8× INT8 throughput.
  - The GPU uses the Navi 48 GPU die manufactured on TSMC's 4nm process with 64 Compute Units.
