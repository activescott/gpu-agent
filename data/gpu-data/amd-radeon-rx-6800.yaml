summary: >-
  The AMD Radeon RX 6800 was released in November 2020 alongside the RX 6800 XT as part
  of AMD's RDNA 2 architecture lineup (Navi 21). It features 60 compute units with 3,840
  stream processors and 16GB of GDDR6 memory with 512 GB/s bandwidth. The card includes
  60 ray tracing acceleration cores and 128MB of Infinity Cache. Built on TSMC's 7nm
  process with 26.8 billion transistors, it delivers 16.17 TFLOPS of FP32 performance
  at a boost clock of 2,105 MHz. With a lower TDP of 250W compared to the XT variant,
  the RX 6800 was positioned to compete with NVIDIA's RTX 3070, offering excellent
  1440p and 4K gaming performance with DirectX 12 Ultimate support including
  hardware-accelerated ray tracing.

notes:
  - FP16 performance is 32.33 TFLOPS calculated at 2:1 ratio to FP32, which is standard for RDNA 2 architecture
  - FP32 TFLOPS calculated as 3,840 stream processors × 2,105 MHz boost clock × 2 ops/cycle = 16.17 TFLOPS
  - Memory bandwidth calculated as 256-bit bus × 16 Gbps effective = 512 GB/s
  - RDNA 2 architecture does not include dedicated AI/ML accelerators or tensor cores
  - The 128MB Infinity Cache significantly improves effective memory bandwidth beyond the raw 512 GB/s specification
  - Built on TSMC 7nm process with the same 520 mm² die size as RX 6800 XT, with some compute units disabled
