title: "GPU Database Update: 9 New Graphics Cards Added"
content: |
  GPU Poet's database has been expanded with nine new graphics cards, building on [last month's database expansion](/news/expanded-gpu-database-update). This update adds AMD's RDNA 2 and RDNA 3 gaming cards, Intel's Battlemage architecture, and NVIDIA's Ampere and Ada Lovelace professional cards. All of these GPUs are ready for comparison with [gaming benchmarks](/gpu/ranking/gaming/counter-strike-2-fps-3840x2160) in Counter-Strike 2 and 3DMark.

  ## AMD Radeon RX 6800 Series - RDNA 2 Gaming

  AMD's RDNA 2 architecture cards from 2020 are now tracked:

  - [AMD Radeon RX 6800](/gpu/learn/card/amd-radeon-rx-6800) - 60 compute units with 3,840 stream processors, 16GB GDDR6, 250W TDP
  - [AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT](/gpu/learn/card/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt) - Full 72 compute units with 4,608 stream processors, 16GB GDDR6, 300W TDP

  Both cards feature 128MB Infinity Cache and hardware-accelerated ray tracing, designed for 1440p and 4K gaming.

  ## AMD Radeon RX 7700 Series - RDNA 3 Gaming

  RDNA 3 architecture cards now available for price tracking:

  - [AMD Radeon RX 7700](/gpu/learn/card/amd-radeon-rx-7700) - Desktop GPU with 40 compute units, 16GB GDDR6, 200W TDP
  - [AMD Radeon RX 7700S](/gpu/learn/card/amd-radeon-rx-7700s) - Mobile variant with 32 compute units, 8GB GDDR6, 100W TDP

  RDNA 3 introduces AI Accelerators for machine learning workloads and improved power efficiency.

  ## AMD Radeon Pro W7700 - Professional Workstation

  - [AMD Radeon Pro W7700](/gpu/learn/card/amd-radeon-pro-w7700) - RDNA 3 workstation card with 48 compute units, 16GB GDDR6 with ECC, 190W TDP

  This professional-grade card targets content creation, CAD, and AI applications with four DisplayPort 2.1 outputs.

  ## Intel Arc B580 - Battlemage Architecture

  - [Intel Arc B580](/gpu/learn/card/intel-arc-b580) - Second-generation Xe2-HPG architecture with 20 Xe-cores, 12GB GDDR6, 190W TDP

  Intel's Battlemage brings 160 XMX engines for AI acceleration and 233 INT8 TOPS, with strong value positioning at $249 MSRP.

  ## NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Series - Ampere Gaming

  Popular Ampere architecture cards now tracked:

  - [NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060](/gpu/learn/card/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060) - GA106 GPU with 3,584 CUDA cores, 12GB GDDR6, 170W TDP
  - [NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti](/gpu/learn/card/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti) - GA104 GPU with 4,864 CUDA cores, 8GB GDDR6, 200W TDP

  Both offer 3rd-generation tensor cores for DLSS and capable performance for 1080p/1440p gaming.

  ## NVIDIA RTX 4000 Ada Generation - Professional Workstation

  - [NVIDIA RTX 4000 Ada Generation](/gpu/learn/card/nvidia-rtx-4000-ada-generation) - Single-slot workstation GPU with 6,144 CUDA cores, 20GB GDDR6 ECC, 130W TDP

  This Ada Lovelace professional card delivers 427.6 tensor TFLOPS with FP8 support and includes AV1 encoding, designed for visualization and AI workloads.
