summary: |
  The Intel Arc B580 is a discrete graphics card launched in December 2024, featuring Intel's second-generation
  Xe2-HPG (Battlemage) architecture on the BMG-G21 silicon. Built on TSMC's 5nm process with 19.6 billion transistors
  on a 272mm² die, the card features 20 Xe-cores (2,560 shading units), 160 XMX (Xe Matrix Extension) engines for
  AI acceleration, and 20 ray tracing units. It includes 12GB of GDDR6 memory on a 192-bit bus running at 19 Gbps,
  delivering 456 GB/s of memory bandwidth. The B580 offers 13.67 TFLOPS of FP32 performance and 233 TOPS of INT8
  performance through its XMX engines, which support FP16, BF16, INT8, and INT4 precision formats for AI/ML
  workloads. With a TDP of 190W and positioned at a $249 launch price, the Arc B580 represents Intel's competitive
  entry into the mainstream discrete GPU market, offering strong AI acceleration capabilities through XMX engines
  and improved architectural efficiency over the previous Alchemist generation. The architecture features enhanced
  vector engines with SIMD16/SIMD32 support, 256KB L1 cache per Xe-core, and 18MB shared L2 cache. Notable features
  include support for DirectX 12 Ultimate, Vulkan 1.4, PCIe 4.0 x8, and Intel's XeSS upscaling technology powered
  by the XMX AI accelerators.

notes:
  - "FP32 TFLOPS calculated as 2,560 shading units × 2.670 GHz boost clock × 2 ops/cycle ÷ 1000 = 13.67 TFLOPS"
  - "FP16 TFLOPS is 27.34 TFLOPS with 2:1 ratio to FP32, per TechPowerUp specifications"
  - "INT8 TOPS of 233 is the official specification from Intel product page, representing peak XMX engine performance"
  - "tensorCoreCount refers to the 160 XMX (Xe Matrix Extension) engines, which are Intel's equivalent to NVIDIA tensor cores and AMD AI accelerators"
  - "XMX engines support FP16, BF16, INT8, INT4, and INT2 data types for matrix operations via DPAS (Dot Product Accumulate Systolic) instruction"
  - "FP32 and FP64 operations are handled by the Xe Vector Engines (XVEs), not the XMX units"
  - "FP64 performance is 1.709 TFLOPS (1:8 ratio to FP32) per TechPowerUp, representing strong double-precision support for a consumer GPU"
  - "Memory bandwidth calculated as 192-bit interface × 19 Gbps = 456 GB/s"
  - "Built on TSMC N5 (5nm) process node with 19.6 billion transistors on 272mm² die"
  - "Architecture features 20 Xe-cores across 5 render slices, with 8 XMX engines per Xe-core (20 × 8 = 160 total XMX engines)"
  - "GPU clock specification from Intel is 2670 MHz for both base and boost on reference design; partner cards may have higher boost clocks"
  - "TDP specified as 190W by Intel, using single 8-pin power connector with 600W PSU recommended"
  - "Launch date: December 13, 2024, with MSRP of $249 USD"
