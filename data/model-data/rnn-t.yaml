summary: |
  Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNN-T) is a framework for automatic speech recognition that provides naturally streaming recognition capabilities. Unlike attention-based models that require full context, RNN-T can predict tokens incrementally, making it ideal for real-time ASR systems. The framework uses a transducer loss function and typically employs a Conformer encoder with a stateless decoder for improved performance.

notes:
  - Original RNN-T paper from 2012; modern implementations use Conformer encoders
  - Parameter count varies by encoder size and vocabulary
  - Transducer loss computation can be memory-intensive for large vocabularies
  - Naturally supports streaming inference without full context
  - Pruned RNN-T variants available for faster, memory-efficient training
