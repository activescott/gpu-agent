summary: >-
  The AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT was released in December 2020 as AMD's flagship gaming GPU
  based on the RDNA 2 architecture (Navi 21 XTX die). It features the full 80 compute
  units with 5,120 stream processors and 16GB of GDDR6 memory with 512 GB/s bandwidth.
  The card includes 80 ray tracing acceleration cores and 128MB of Infinity Cache to
  significantly boost effective memory bandwidth. Built on TSMC's 7nm process with a
  520 mm² die containing 26.8 billion transistors, it delivers 23.04 TFLOPS of FP32
  performance at a boost clock of 2,250 MHz. With a TDP of 300W, the RX 6900 XT was
  designed to compete with NVIDIA's RTX 3090, offering excellent 4K gaming performance
  with DirectX 12 Ultimate support including hardware-accelerated ray tracing and
  variable rate shading. It represented AMD's return to the high-end GPU market after
  years of ceding that segment to NVIDIA.

notes:
  - FP32 TFLOPS calculated as 5,120 stream processors × 2,250 MHz boost clock × 2 ops/cycle / 1,000,000 = 23.04 TFLOPS
  - FP16 performance is 46.08 TFLOPS calculated at 2:1 ratio to FP32, which is standard for RDNA 2 architecture
  - Memory bandwidth calculated as 256-bit bus × 16 Gbps effective = 512 GB/s
  - RDNA 2 architecture does not include dedicated AI accelerators or tensor cores (added in RDNA 3), so tensorCoreCount is null
  - "RDNA 2 CUs support INT8 and INT4 data types and have INT8 matrix core support per ROCm documentation, but lack the WMMA (Wave Matrix Multiply Accumulate) instructions added in RDNA 3. AMD does not publish INT8 TOPS for consumer RDNA 2 GPUs, so int8TOPS is null. Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDNA_2, https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/reference/precision-support.html"
  - The 128MB Infinity Cache significantly improves effective memory bandwidth beyond the raw 512 GB/s specification
