summary: >-
  The AMD Radeon Pro W7900 is AMD's flagship RDNA 3 professional workstation graphics card, launched in
  April 2023 on the full Navi 31 GPU. Built on TSMC's 5nm process with a chiplet design, the card
  features 96 compute units with 6,144 stream processors and 192 AI Accelerators for enhanced machine
  learning performance. It includes 96 second-generation ray tracing accelerators and 48GB of GDDR6
  memory with ECC support on a 384-bit bus, delivering 864 GB/s of bandwidth. The W7900 offers 61 TFLOPS
  of FP32 performance and 122 TFLOPS FP16 performance. With a TDP of 295W and positioned at $3,999 at
  launch, this dual-slot blower-style card targets high-end professional content creation, CAD,
  simulation, and AI workloads. It features three DisplayPort 2.1 outputs with UHBR 20 support
  providing up to 80 Gb/s of display bandwidth per port.
