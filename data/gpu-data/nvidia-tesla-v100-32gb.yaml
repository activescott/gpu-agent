  - "Estimated MSRP of $11,500 USD for Tesla V100 32GB PCIe based on launch-time market pricing. NVIDIA does not publish official MSRP for data center GPUs. Microway's price analysis from 2018 lists single-unit list price at $11,458 for the 32GB PCIe variant. The 32GB model launched in March 2018, approximately 9 months after the 16GB variant, with a premium of approximately $800-$1,500 over the 16GB version. Note: Pricing varies by form factor (PCIe vs SXM2) and purchase volume. The SXM2 variant commanded a significant premium (approximately $15,900 for 16GB SXM2 vs $9,900-$10,664 for 16GB PCIe)."
