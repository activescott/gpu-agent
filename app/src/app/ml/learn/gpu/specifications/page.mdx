# Demystifying Technical Specifications for Machine Learning GPUs & Accelerators

When selecting GPUs for training or deploying large deep learning models, several crucial technical specifications should be carefully considered:

  <Feature title="Tensor Cores: The Engines of Deep Learning" icon="cpu">
    Tensor cores are specialized hardware accelerators designed to efficiently
    execute matrix multiplication, the cornerstone of deep learning
    computations. Since deep learning workloads are highly parallelizable,
    having a greater number of tensor cores generally translates to improved
    performance.
  </Feature>
  <Feature title="Memory Capacity: Storing the Data" icon="memory">
    The amount of onboard memory, typically measured in gigabytes (GB),
    determines the capacity to store the training data and intermediate results.
    Larger models demand more memory, both for training and inference.
  </Feature>
  <Feature
    title="Memory Bandwidth: Accessing Data Efficiently"
    icon="speedometer"
  >
    Memory bandwidth measures the rate at which data can be transferred to and
    from the GPU, measured in gigabytes per second (GB/s). In many cases, tensor
    cores may be idle while waiting for matrices to be moved in and out of
    memory. Adequate memory bandwidth is essential for optimal performance.

## Precision Matters: Balancing Accuracy and Efficiency

Deep learning models can be trained and deployed using different precision levels, such as single-precision (FP32), half-precision (FP16), or mixed precision (FP32/FP16). Each GPU has different performance for different precision levels, significantly impacting training and inference performance.

  <Feature title="FP16 Performance" icon="lightning">
    Also measured in teraflops (TFLOPS), FP16 performance indicates the GPU's
    speed in handling 16-bit floating-point operations.

## Choosing the Right Precision: A Delicate Balance

The most commonly used precision levels in state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models are FP32 and FP16. FP32 (single-precision) is the standard precision format, offering high accuracy but also demanding significant computational resources and memory bandwidth. FP16 (half-precision) strikes a balance between accuracy and efficiency, reducing memory requirements and computational costs by using 16-bit floating-point numbers instead of 32-bit.

The choice of precision depends on the specific model and application. Some models may experience significant accuracy degradation when using lower precision, while others may not. Generally, it's essential to evaluate the particular model and its intended use to determine the relevant precision levels.

### Quantization: Evolving Techniques for Lower Precision

Quantization techniques are continuously evolving to enable effective use of lower precisions in deep learning. These techniques, such as post-training quantization, involve optimizing the model's weights and activations to lower precision formats without compromising accuracy.
