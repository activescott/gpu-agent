summary: |
  3D-UNet is an extension of the U-Net architecture adapted for three-dimensional volumetric data segmentation. Its primary innovation lies in learning from sparsely annotated volumetric images, reducing the extensive manual effort typically required in medical image analysis. The model uses 3D convolutions and skip connections to capture both local and contextual information in volumetric data, enabling accurate segmentation of complex structures.
useCase: Volumetric segmentation of medical images, biomedical image analysis, CT/MRI scan segmentation

notes:
  - GPU memory requirements vary significantly with input volume dimensions
  - Best suited for research and non-critical clinical applications
  - Care required in application to clinical diagnostic processes
  - Can learn from sparsely annotated data (not all slices need labels)
  - While the original 3D-UNet paper (2016) evaluated on Xenopus kidney segmentation, the architecture has been widely adopted for BraTS brain tumor segmentation in subsequent research
  - Parameter count of 19M is based on typical implementation; actual count varies depending on network depth and feature map sizes
