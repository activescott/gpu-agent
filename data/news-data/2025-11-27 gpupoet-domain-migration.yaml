title: "We've Moved: Welcome to GPUPoet.com"
content: |
  coinpoet.com has a new home at gpupoet.com!

  ## Why the Change?

  This project started as a small experiment, so I reused a domain from a former project that never really materialized. Now that more and more users are finding value in the site, a more descriptive domain seemed appropriate.

  ## What This Means for You

  - All your bookmarks will automatically redirect to the new domain
  - All existing links will continue to work
  - Nothing else changes - same features, same data, same experience

  ## Share the Love

  If you find GPUPoet.com useful, I'd be grateful if you'd share it with others who might benefit. Send a link to a friend, share it on Reddit, or post it wherever is convenient for you!
