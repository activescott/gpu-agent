  - "Estimated MSRP of $10,000 USD for Tesla V100 16GB PCIe based on launch-time market pricing. NVIDIA does not publish official MSRP for data center GPUs. Multiple sources from 2017-2018 cite pricing in the $8,000-$10,664 range: Microway's price analysis lists single-unit list price at $10,664, CDW retailer pricing from March 2018 at $9,900 (per Next Platform), and general tech sources cite launch range of $8,000-$10,000. Note: Pricing varies by form factor (PCIe vs SXM2) and purchase volume."
