summary: The NVIDIA A100 PCIe 80GB was announced in May 2020, is a formidable
  accelerator in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
  Built on NVIDIA's advanced Ampere architecture, this accelerator is designed
  for high-performance computing, deep learning training, and inference tasks.
  With its massive 80 GB of HBM2e memory and superior memory bandwidth of 1,935
  GB/s, it caters to the most demanding AI workloads. The inclusion of 432
  tensor cores significantly accelerates machine learning applications, making
  it a go-to choice for researchers and data scientists. Operating at a base
  clock of 1065 MHz and a boost clock up to 1410 MHz, it delivers impressive
  computational power, capped at a maximum power consumption of 300 watts. The
  A100-PCIE-80GB is notable for its high FP32 performance of 19.5 TFLOPS,
  emphasizing its capability in handling floating-point operations efficiently.
