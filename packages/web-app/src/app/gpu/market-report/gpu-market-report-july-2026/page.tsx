          June was a buyer&apos;s market. Prices fell across the board:
          mainstream cards dropped roughly 20% month-over-month (the{" "}
          <Link href="/gpu/shop/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti">RTX 3080 Ti</Link>{" "}

          <Link href="/gpu/shop/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt">RX 6800 XT</Link> from
          $316 to $272). Two things came out of that. First, the{" "}
          <Link href="/gpu/shop/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090">RTX 5090</Link> resale
          premium cooled from 83% above MSRP in May to 52% in June. Second, used
          Ampere and RDNA2 cards hit their best value yet, led by the{" "}
          <Link href="/gpu/shop/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti">RTX 3060 Ti</Link>{" "}
          at $1.13/FPS for 1440p. Below I break down the best bang for your buck
          by use case, using June&apos;s best-deal pricing across eBay and
          Amazon (average of the 3 cheapest listings).

          same $/FPS as the 7600 but with 16GB of VRAM and a lot more raw
          performance. The{" "}
