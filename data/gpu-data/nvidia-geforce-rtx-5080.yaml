summary: |
  The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 was the first GeForce RTX 50 series product that was launched using the GB203 GPU.
  NVIDIA unveiled the GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs on January 6, 2025, powered by the Blackwell architecture, featuring advanced AI and ray tracing capabilities. RTX 50 Series GPUs support 5th Gen Tensor Cores.

  Other key features include DLSS 4 which uses AI to generate up to three additional frames per traditionally rendered frame boosting frame rates, and the RTX Neural Shaders integrate small AI networks into the shading process, enabling higher quality rendering. RTX Neural Faces uses generative AI to create highly realistic digital human faces. NVIDIA ACE empowers game characters with AI-driven perception, planning, and action.
  These GPUs are designed for gamers, creators, and developers, offering significant performance gains over the RTX 40 series for AI, lifelike in-game characters and AI-powered creative tools. The GeForce RTX 5090 is the flagship model of the RTX 50 series and will be available on January 30th 2025, with other models following in the coming months.

  Cheaper options in the RTX 50 series, including the RTX 5070 and RTX 5080.

notes:
  - We use the peak TOPS/FLOPS specs using the sparsity feature.
  - Blackwell GB203 is the chip
  - fp16TFLOPS is "Peak FP16 Tensor TFLOPS with FP16 Accumulate" as that's what NVIDIA publishes.
  - int8TOPS is "peak INT 8 TOPS" using "Effective TOPS / TFLOPS using the new Sparsity Feature". They also reveal it as 660.6 "based on GPU Boost Clock". This comes from the blackwell gpu architecture pdf.
  - fp32TFLOPS is "Peak TF32 Tensor TFLOPS1" as published in the blackwell gpu architecture pdf.
