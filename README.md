GPU Agent provides machine learning performance metrics for all the most popular GPUs for Machine Learning. It also includes near real-time listings for GPUs aimed at Machine LEarning across multiple sites (currently eBay is supported). You can compare one GPU to another as well as see the cost/performance metrics of GPUs based on real-time prices.

GPU Agent is a project I created to scratch an itch I've had since I used to buy and sell GPUs for mining cryptocurrency. With the rise of interest in GPUs that the excitement around LLMs brought I decided to pursue it.

The tech stack used is TypeScript, NextJS, Prisma, and PostgresSQL.
