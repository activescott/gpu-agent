# About Machine Learning Model BERT

BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a revolutionary model in natural language processing, introduced by Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, and Kristina Toutanova from Google AI Language in 2018. BERT is a deep learning model that uniquely focuses on pre-training deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text. This approach enables the model to understand the context of a word based on all of its surroundings (left and right of the word). BERT has achieved state-of-the-art results in a wide range of natural language processing tasks, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness.
