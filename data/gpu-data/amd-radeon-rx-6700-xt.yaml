summary: >-
  The AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT was released in March 2021 as a mid-range gaming GPU
  based on the RDNA 2 architecture (Navi 22 XT die). It features 40 compute units
  with 2,560 stream processors and 12GB of GDDR6 memory with 384 GB/s bandwidth
  on a 192-bit bus. The card includes 40 ray tracing acceleration cores and 96MB
  of Infinity Cache. Built on TSMC's 7nm process with a 335 mm² die containing
  17.2 billion transistors, it delivers 13.21 TFLOPS of FP32 performance at a
  boost clock of 2,581 MHz. With a TDP of 230W, the RX 6700 XT was designed as
  AMD's primary 1440p gaming card, competing with NVIDIA's RTX 3060 Ti and RTX
  3070. It offers excellent performance per watt and solid 1440p gaming with
  DirectX 12 Ultimate support including hardware-accelerated ray tracing.

notes:
  - FP32 TFLOPS calculated as 2,560 stream processors × 2,581 MHz boost clock × 2 ops/cycle / 1,000,000 = 13.21 TFLOPS
  - FP16 performance is 26.43 TFLOPS per TechPowerUp GPU Database (2:1 ratio to FP32, standard for RDNA 2 architecture)
  - Memory bandwidth calculated as 192-bit bus × 16 Gbps effective / 8 = 384 GB/s
  - RDNA 2 architecture does not include dedicated AI accelerators or tensor cores (added in RDNA 3), so tensorCoreCount is null
  - RDNA 2 CUs support INT8 and INT4 data types and have INT8 matrix core support per ROCm documentation, but lack the WMMA (Wave Matrix Multiply Accumulate) instructions added in RDNA 3. AMD does not publish INT8 TOPS for consumer RDNA 2 GPUs, so int8TOPS is null. Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDNA_2, https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/reference/precision-support.html
  - The 96MB Infinity Cache significantly improves effective memory bandwidth beyond the raw 384 GB/s specification
  - Built on TSMC 7nm process with 335 mm² die size containing 17.2 billion transistors
