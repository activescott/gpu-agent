summary: |
  The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER is a high-performance graphics card released in January 2024,
  featuring the Ada Lovelace architecture based on the AD103 GPU. It offers 8,448 CUDA cores,
  264 4th-generation tensor cores, and 16GB of GDDR6X memory running at 21 Gbps, delivering
  706 AI TOPS for INT8 workloads with sparsity. The card represents a significant upgrade over
  the RTX 4070 Ti, offering 10% more CUDA cores (8,448 vs 7,680), 33% more VRAM (16GB vs 12GB),
  and a wider 256-bit memory bus (vs 192-bit) while maintaining the same 285W TDP. The RTX 4070 Ti
  SUPER is positioned between the RTX 4070 Ti and RTX 4080, providing excellent performance for
  both high-refresh 1440p and 4K gaming as well as machine learning inference workloads. It uses
  a PCI-Express 4.0 x16 interface and features 672.3 GB/s memory bandwidth. The card launched at
  $799 USD, offering strong value in the enthusiast segment.

notes:
  - MSRP of $799 USD sourced from NVIDIA's official announcement. Note that no Founders Edition was released for the RTX 4070 Ti SUPER (partner cards only). The $799 price matches the original RTX 4070 Ti while offering significantly better specifications.
  - fp32TFLOPS of 44.10 per TechPowerUp GPU Database, which represents shader FP32 performance calculated as 8,448 CUDA cores × 2.610 GHz boost clock × 2 ops/cycle / 1000 = 44.10 TFLOPS.
  - fp16TFLOPS of 353 represents Peak FP16 Tensor TFLOPS with sparsity, derived from the architectural behavior of 4th-gen tensor cores where each core performs 256 FP16 operations per clock (512 with sparsity). Calculated as 264 tensor cores × 512 ops × 2.610 GHz / 1000 ≈ 353 TFLOPS. Note that NVIDIA does not explicitly publish FP16 tensor performance for GeForce GPUs.
  - int8TOPS of 706 is "peak INT8 TOPS" using "Effective TOPS using the new Sparsity Feature" as reported in reviews. Dense performance without sparsity would be approximately 353 TOPS.
  - FP8 is supported at the hardware level by 4th-gen tensor cores. However, NVIDIA's Transformer Engine library requires compute capability 9.x (Hopper/H100) and does not support Ada GPUs (8.9) for FP8 operations. Lower-level libraries like cuBLASLt, TensorRT-LLM, and llama.cpp can utilize FP8 on Ada GPUs. See https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/4090-doesnt-have-fp8-compute/232256
  - Power based on what NVIDIA refers to as "TGP (Total Graphics Power)".
  - The RTX 4070 Ti SUPER uses the AD103-275-A1 variant of the AD103 chip.
  - Memory bandwidth calculated as 256-bit interface × 21 Gbps effective / 8 = 672 GB/s.
  - Process node is TSMC 4N (5nm-class) with 45.9 billion transistors and a die size of 379 mm².
  - Compared to the standard RTX 4070 Ti, the SUPER variant offers approximately 10% more CUDA cores, 33% more VRAM, 33% more memory bandwidth, and improved 4K gaming performance.
