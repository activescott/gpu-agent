title: "New GPU Comparison Tool: Compare Any Two GPUs Side-by-Side"
content: |
  GPU Poet now features a dedicated [GPU Comparison Tool](/gpu/compare) that lets you compare any two graphics cards side-by-side.

  ## What You Can Compare

  The comparison page shows specs, gaming benchmarks, and current pricing for both GPUs in a single view:

  - **Specifications**: Memory, compute performance, power draw, and more with percentile rankings
  - **Gaming Benchmarks**: FPS data from Counter-Strike 2, 3DMark, Quake II RTX, and other games
  - **Live Pricing**: Current lowest prices and listing counts with direct links to shop

  ## Winner Highlighting

  When one GPU significantly outperforms the other on a metric, that GPU's progress bar animates to draw your attention. This makes it easy to scan the table and see which card wins each category.

  ## Shareable URLs

  Each comparison has a unique URL like `/gpu/compare/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080/vs/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090`. Bookmark comparisons or share them with friends who are also shopping for GPUs.

  ## How to Use It

  1. Visit the [GPU Comparison page](/gpu/compare)
  2. Select two GPUs using the search dropdowns
  3. Review specs, benchmarks, and prices side-by-side
  4. Click pricing links to shop for either card
