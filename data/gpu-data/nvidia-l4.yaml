summary: The NVIDIA L4 GPU was introduced in March 2023 with part number
  900-2G193-0000-000. It, along with the L40 are the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace
  architecture built using the Built on the 5 nm process. The L4 uses the AD104
  graphics processor, fourth-generation Tensor Cores, deep learning super
  sampling (DLSS 3) and 24 GB GDDR6 memory. The L4 is unique in that its maximum
  power draw is only 72 W which is quite low compared with other Tensor Core
  GPUs such as the such as the L40 at 300W and L40S at 350W. It is a single-slot
  PCIe 4.0 x16 card without connectivity for monitors.
