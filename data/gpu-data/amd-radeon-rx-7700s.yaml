summary: >-
  The AMD Radeon RX 7700S is a mobile graphics card launched in January 2023, featuring
  AMD's RDNA 3 architecture based on the Navi 33 XT GPU variant. Built on TSMC's 6nm process,
  it features 32 compute units with 2,048 stream processors and 64 AI Accelerators for
  machine learning acceleration. The card includes 32 second-generation ray tracing accelerators
  and 8GB of GDDR6 memory on a 128-bit bus running at 18 Gbps, delivering 288 GB/s of bandwidth.
  With a boost clock of 2,500 MHz, it delivers 20.48 TFLOPS of FP32 performance. Designed for
  gaming laptops, the RX 7700S has a TDP of 100W, making it power-efficient for mobile platforms
  while still offering strong gaming performance. It features 32MB of Infinity Cache (L3) to
  enhance effective memory bandwidth and supports DirectX 12 Ultimate with hardware-accelerated
  ray tracing and variable rate shading. The card is designed for high-quality 1080p and 1440p
  gaming in mobile form factors.

notes:
  - FP32 TFLOPS of 20.48 per TechPowerUp GPU Database and multiple authoritative sources
  - FP16 performance is 40.96 TFLOPS at 2:1 ratio to FP32, standard for RDNA 3 architecture
  - Note on calculation - Simple formula (2048 SPs × 2.5 GHz × 2) yields 10.24 TFLOPS, but authoritative sources consistently report 20.48 TFLOPS, suggesting RDNA 3 achieves higher effective throughput
  - tensorCoreCount of 64 represents the AI Accelerators (2 per compute unit × 32 compute units)
  - Memory bandwidth calculated as 128-bit bus × 18 Gbps effective = 288 GB/s
  - RDNA 3 architecture includes dedicated AI Accelerators for machine learning workloads
  - Built on TSMC 6nm process with Navi 33 XT GPU variant
  - Features 32MB of Infinity Cache (L3) in addition to 2MB L2 cache
  - Base clock of 1,500 MHz with boost to 2,500 MHz
  - Mobile GPU designed for laptop/notebook systems
  - MSRP of $300 is an estimated component value. The RX 7700S is a mobile-only GPU sold exclusively integrated into laptops, not as a standalone retail product. AMD does not publish official MSRP for mobile GPU components. This estimate is based on market positioning between NVIDIA RTX 4050 and RTX 4060 mobile GPUs, and relative to the desktop RX 7600's $269 MSRP. The RX 7700S offers performance comparable to or exceeding RTX 3060 desktop and trades blows with mobile RTX 3070.
  - No official AMD OPN (Ordering Part Number) or other manufacturer identifiers were found in public documentation for the RX 7700S. AMD does not typically publish OPNs for mobile consumer GPUs, which are integrated into laptop designs rather than sold as discrete retail products.
  - The RX 7700S is a mobile GPU sold only through OEM laptop manufacturers. As of December 2025, primary OEM partners include ASUS (TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition) and Framework (Laptop 16 Graphics Module). ASUS ROG Strix filter pages show the RX 7700S GPU option but no specific ROG Strix models were found with this GPU.
  - A 120W variant of the RX 7700S exists in some laptop configurations, offering higher performance at increased power consumption.
