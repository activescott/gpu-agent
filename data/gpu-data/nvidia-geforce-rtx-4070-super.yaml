summary: |
  The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER is a high-performance graphics card released in January 2024,
  featuring the Ada Lovelace architecture based on the AD104 GPU. It offers 7,168 CUDA cores,
  224 4th-generation tensor cores, and 12GB of GDDR6X memory running at 21 Gbps, delivering
  568 AI TOPS for INT8 workloads with sparsity. The card represents a mid-generation refresh
  of the RTX 4070, offering significantly improved performance with 21% more CUDA cores (7,168
  vs 5,888) while maintaining the same 220W TDP. The RTX 4070 SUPER provides excellent
  performance for both 1440p/4K gaming and machine learning workloads. It uses a PCI-Express
  4.0 x16 interface and features 504 GB/s memory bandwidth on a 192-bit bus.

notes:
  - fp16TFLOPS of 141.93 represents "Peak FP16 Tensor TFLOPS with FP16 Accumulate" using the "with sparsity" metric. Dense performance is 70.96 TFLOPS, sparse is 141.93 TFLOPS. Following the same pattern as other Ada GPUs, NVIDIA publishes the sparse performance.
  - int8TOPS of 567.71 is "peak INT8 TOPS" using "Effective TOPS using the new Sparsity Feature". Dense performance is 283.85 TOPS, sparse is 567.71 TOPS.
  - fp32TFLOPS calculated as 7,168 CUDA cores × 2.475 GHz boost clock × 4 ops/cycle = 70.96 TFLOPS standard or 35.48 TFLOPS for non-tensor operations. The "4 ops/cycle" comes from Ada Lovelace's dual-issue FP32 capability where each SM can execute 2 FP32 operations on the dedicated FP32 pipeline plus 2 more FP32 operations on the INT32/FP32 shared pipeline, totaling 4 FP32 ops per cycle under optimal conditions.
  - Power based on what NVIDIA refers to as "TGP (Total Graphics Power)".
  - The RTX 4070 SUPER uses the AD104-350 variant of the AD104 chip with 56 of 60 streaming multiprocessors enabled.
  - Memory bandwidth calculated as 192-bit interface × 21 Gbps = 504 GB/s.
  - Process node is TSMC 4N (5nm-class) with 35.8 billion transistors.
  - The RTX 4070 SUPER offers significantly better value than the original RTX 4070, with 21% more CUDA cores and 12GB VRAM (vs 12GB) at the same MSRP and power envelope.
