summary: >-
  The AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT was released alongside the RX 7900 XTX on December
  13, 2022 as one of the GPUs using the new RDNA 3 architecture.
        It includes RDNA 3 architecture's new AI Accelerators which accelerate the GEMM operations that are critical to machine learning/AI performance.
        With 84 compute units (CUs) and 168 AI Accelerators, it has 12 fewer (CUs), and 6 fewer AI Accelerators than the 7900 XTX but remains a strong contender in the high-performance GPU market.
        Some common part numbers are the PowerColor RX7900XT 20G-L/OC, Sapphire 11323-02-20G, XFX RX-79TMERCU9.
        The lowest price is tracked and continuously updated across multiple sellers for all of these models below.
