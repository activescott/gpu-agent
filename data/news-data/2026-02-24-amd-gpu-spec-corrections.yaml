title: "AMD GPU Specification Corrections: R9700, RX 7900 GRE, and RDNA 3 INT8 Updates"
content: |
  I've corrected several AMD GPU specifications after a community member reported inaccuracies in the database. Thanks to that report, I did a thorough review against AMD's official datasheets and documentation.

  ## What Was Fixed

  The [AMD Radeon AI PRO R9700](/gpu/learn/card/amd-radeon-ai-pro-r9700) had two specification errors from AMD's official datasheet: FP16 performance is 95.7 TFLOPS (not 96), and INT8 performance is 383 TOPS (not 192).

  The [AMD Radeon RX 7900 GRE](/gpu/learn/card/amd-radeon-rx-7900-gre) had an incorrect INT8 value. AMD's RDNA 3 architecture supports INT8 at the same throughput as FP16 (1:1 ratio), confirmed by the [WMMA documentation on GPUOpen](https://gpuopen.com/learn/wmma_on_rdna3/). The RX 7900 GRE is now listed at 91.96 INT8 TOPS instead of 183.92.

  I also added missing INT8 TOPS values for four other RDNA 3 cards: [RX 7800 XT](/gpu/learn/card/amd-radeon-rx-7800-xt), [RX 7700 XT](/gpu/learn/card/amd-radeon-rx-7700-xt), [RX 7600 XT](/gpu/learn/card/amd-radeon-rx-7600-xt), and [RX 7600](/gpu/learn/card/amd-radeon-rx-7600).

  Product identifiers for third-party R9700 models (XFX, ASRock, Sapphire) were also corrected.

  ## Community Feedback

  I appreciate the detailed bug report. User feedback like this helps keep GPU Poet's data accurate. All specifications now cite official AMD sources.
