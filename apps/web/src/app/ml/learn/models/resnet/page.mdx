# About Machine Learning Model ResNet

ResNet, short for Residual Network, introduced by Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun from Microsoft Research in 2015, marked a significant breakthrough in the field of deep learning for image recognition. ResNet addresses the degradation problem in very deep networks by introducing a novel deep residual learning framework. This framework makes it feasible to train networks with unprecedented depth (up to 152 layers), resulting in major improvements in accuracy on challenging datasets like ImageNet and CIFAR-10. The innovative use of residual blocks allows for easier optimization and better performance, establishing ResNet as a foundational model in deep learning for visual recognition tasks.
