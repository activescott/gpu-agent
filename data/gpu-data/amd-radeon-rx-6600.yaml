summary: >-
  The AMD Radeon RX 6600 was released in October 2021 as an affordable mainstream
  gaming GPU based on the RDNA 2 architecture (Navi 23 XL die). It features 28
  compute units with 1,792 stream processors and 8GB of GDDR6 memory with 224 GB/s
  bandwidth on a 128-bit bus. The card includes 28 ray tracing acceleration cores
  and 32MB of Infinity Cache. Built on TSMC's 7nm process with a 237 mm² die
  containing 11.06 billion transistors, it delivers 8.93 TFLOPS of FP32 performance
  at a boost clock of 2,491 MHz. With a TDP of only 132W, the RX 6600 was designed
  as AMD's most efficient 1080p gaming card, offering excellent performance per
  watt at a lower price point than the RX 6600 XT. It competes with NVIDIA's RTX
  3060 and offers solid 1080p gaming with DirectX 12 Ultimate support including
  hardware-accelerated ray tracing. It uses a PCIe 4.0 x8 interface.

notes:
  - FP32 TFLOPS calculated as 1,792 stream processors × 2,491 MHz boost clock × 2 ops/cycle / 1,000,000 = 8.93 TFLOPS
  - FP16 performance is 17.86 TFLOPS calculated at 2:1 ratio to FP32, which is standard for RDNA 2 architecture
  - Memory bandwidth of 224 GB/s calculated as 128-bit bus × 14 Gbps effective / 8
  - RDNA 2 architecture does not include dedicated AI accelerators or tensor cores (added in RDNA 3), so tensorCoreCount is null
  - "RDNA 2 CUs support INT8 and INT4 data types and have INT8 matrix core support per ROCm documentation, but lack the WMMA (Wave Matrix Multiply Accumulate) instructions added in RDNA 3. AMD does not publish INT8 TOPS for consumer RDNA 2 GPUs, so int8TOPS is null. Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDNA_2, https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/reference/precision-support.html"
  - The 32MB Infinity Cache significantly improves effective memory bandwidth beyond the raw 224 GB/s specification
  - Built on TSMC 7nm process with 237 mm² die size containing 11.06 billion transistors
  - Uses the Navi 23 XL die with 4 compute units disabled compared to the RX 6600 XT
  - Uses PCIe 4.0 x8 interface instead of x16
  - MSRP of $329 USD verified from multiple sources including Tom's Hardware, AnandTech, and GSMArena at launch on October 13, 2021
