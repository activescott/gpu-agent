summary: >-
  The AMD Radeon Pro W7500 is a professional workstation graphics card launched on August 3, 2023,
  featuring AMD's RDNA 3 architecture on the Navi 33 GPU. Built on TSMC's 6nm process with a
  monolithic design containing 13.3 billion transistors on a 204 mm² die, the card features 28
  compute units with 1,792 stream processors and 56 AI Accelerators for enhanced machine learning
  performance. It includes 28 second-generation ray tracing accelerators and 8GB of GDDR6 memory
  on a 128-bit bus, delivering 172 GB/s of bandwidth. The W7500 offers 12.19 TFLOPS of FP32
  performance at a boost clock of 1,700 MHz and 24.38 TFLOPS of FP16 performance. With an extremely
  efficient TDP of 70W, the card requires no additional power connectors and is powered entirely
  by the PCIe 4.0 x8 slot, making it ideal for systems with less-capable power supplies. Positioned
  at $429, this single-slot card targets mainstream professional content creation, CAD, and
  entry-level DCC workloads. It features four DisplayPort 2.1 outputs with UHBR 10 support providing
  up to 38.7 Gb/s of display link bandwidth, supporting resolutions up to 8K, making it suitable
  for multi-display professional workflows.

notes:
  - FP32 TFLOPS of 12.19 sourced from multiple technical databases (CG Channel, WCCFtech, CpuTronic, GPU Decision), calculated as 1,792 stream processors × 1,700 MHz boost clock × 2 ops/cycle ÷ 1000 = 6.09 TFLOPS per compute operation, with full precision yielding 12.19 TFLOPS
  - FP16 performance of 24.38 TFLOPS sourced from technical databases, calculated at 2:1 ratio to FP32, which is standard for RDNA 3 architecture
  - tensorCoreCount of 56 represents the AI Accelerators (2 per compute unit × 28 compute units)
  - Memory bandwidth calculated as 128-bit bus × 10.8 Gbps effective (1344 MHz × 8) ÷ 8 = 172.8 GB/s, rounded to 172 GB/s
  - Memory speed is 10.8-11 Gbps GDDR6 per multiple sources
  - RDNA 3 architecture includes dedicated AI Accelerators for machine learning workloads
  - Built on TSMC 6nm process with monolithic design (Navi 33 die) containing 13.3 billion transistors on a 204 mm² die
  - Released August 3, 2023 at $429 USD MSRP per AMD official press release
  - TDP of 70W allows the card to be powered entirely by PCIe slot without additional power connectors, making it suitable for systems with limited power supply capacity
  - DisplayPort 2.1 with UHBR 10 support provides up to 38.7 Gb/s display link bandwidth, supporting resolutions up to 10K at 60 Hz with DSC
  - Base clock is 1,500 MHz, boost clock is 1,700 MHz per multiple technical sources
  - The W7500 uses the same Navi 33 GPU as the W7600 but with fewer enabled compute units (28 vs 32) and slower memory (10.8 Gbps vs 18 Gbps)
  - MSRP of $429 USD sourced from AMD official press release dated August 3, 2023
