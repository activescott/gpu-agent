summary: >-
  The AMD Radeon RX 7700 is a desktop gaming graphics card based on the RDNA 3 architecture
  using the Navi 32 GPU. Built on TSMC's 5nm process, it features 40 compute units with 2,560
  stream processors and 80 AI Accelerators (matrix cores) for enhanced AI/ML performance.
  The card includes 40 second-generation ray tracing accelerators and 16GB of GDDR6 memory
  on a 256-bit bus running at 19.4 Gbps, delivering 622.1 GB/s of bandwidth. With a boost
  clock of 2,600 MHz, it delivers 26.62 TFLOPS of FP32 performance. The RX 7700 has a TDP
  of 200W and requires a single 8-pin power connector. It features 64MB of Infinity Cache
  (L3) to boost effective memory bandwidth and supports DirectX 12 Ultimate with hardware-
  accelerated ray tracing and variable rate shading. The card uses a PCIe 4.0 x16 interface
  and is designed for high-performance 1440p and 4K gaming.

notes:
  - FP32 TFLOPS of 26.62 calculated as 2,560 stream processors × 2,600 MHz boost clock × 2 ops/cycle = 26.62 TFLOPS
  - FP16 performance is 53.25 TFLOPS calculated at 2:1 ratio to FP32, standard for RDNA 3 architecture
  - tensorCoreCount of 80 represents the AI Accelerators/matrix cores (2 per compute unit × 40 compute units)
  - Memory bandwidth calculated as 256-bit bus × 19.4 Gbps effective = 622.1 GB/s
  - RDNA 3 architecture includes dedicated AI Accelerators for machine learning workloads
  - Built on TSMC 5nm process with Navi 32 GPU die
  - Features 64MB of Infinity Cache (L3) in addition to 2MB L2 cache
  - Base clock of 1,900 MHz with boost to 2,600 MHz
