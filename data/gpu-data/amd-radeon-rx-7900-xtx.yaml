summary: >-
  The AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX, launched on December 13, 2022, is AMD's flagship
  graphics card on the new RDNA 3 architecture. 
        The RDNA 3 architecture features AI Accelerators and a significant performance boost over its predecessors. The 7900 XTX has 96 compute units (CUs) and 192 AI accelerators. The AI Accelerators accelerate the GEMM operation which are critical to machine learning/AI performance. 
        The 7900 XTX is a compelling GPU for machine learning/AI.
        Some common part numbers are the PowerColor RX7900XTX 24G-E/OC, RX7900XTX 24G-L/OC, Sapphire 11322-02-20G, XFX RX-79XMERCB9, ASRock 90-GA43ZZ-00UANF, and the Asus TUF-RX7900XTX-O24G-GAMING.
