summary: |
  The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 is a high-performance graphics card released in October 2020,
  featuring the Ampere architecture based on the GA104 GPU. It offers 5,888 CUDA cores,
  184 3rd-generation tensor cores, and 8GB of GDDR6 memory running at 14 Gbps, delivering
  325 AI TOPS for INT8 workloads with sparsity. The card was designed to match or exceed
  the performance of the previous generation's flagship RTX 2080 Ti while being more affordable.
  With a TDP of 220W, it provides excellent performance-per-watt for both gaming at 1440p/4K
  and machine learning inference workloads. The RTX 3070 uses a PCI-Express 4.0 x16 interface
  and features 448 GB/s memory bandwidth on a 256-bit bus.

notes:
  - fp16TFLOPS of 81.25 represents "Peak FP16 Tensor TFLOPS" using the "with sparsity" metric. Dense performance is 40.63 TFLOPS, sparse is 81.25 TFLOPS. Following Ampere architecture standards, NVIDIA publishes sparse tensor performance.
  - int8TOPS of 325.02 is "peak INT8 TOPS" using "Effective TOPS using the Sparsity Feature". Dense performance is 162.51 TOPS, sparse is 325.02 TOPS.
  - fp32TFLOPS calculated as 5,888 CUDA cores × 1.725 GHz boost clock × 2 ops/cycle = 20.31 TFLOPS. Ampere architecture features 2 FP32 ops per cycle through dedicated FP32 datapath and shared INT32/FP32 datapath.
  - Power based on what NVIDIA refers to as "TGP (Total Graphics Power)".
  - The RTX 3070 uses the GA104-300 variant of the GA104 chip with 46 of 48 streaming multiprocessors enabled.
  - Memory bandwidth calculated as 256-bit interface × 14 Gbps = 448 GB/s.
  - Process node is Samsung 8nm with approximately 17.4 billion transistors.
  - At launch, the RTX 3070 was positioned to match the RTX 2080 Ti's performance at a significantly lower price point.
