Interesting site! You're probably aware of some of the following feedback, but here's what I noticed.

- [+] 1. The top level nav items have a ton of sub-elements. Makes it feel way less inviting because I've gotta make a lot more choices to start shopping.

  Recommendation: Give me fewer high-level options like Shop > Browse | Compare.

  You could even make each category of action a link in the top nav: Browse | Compare | Rankings.

  Since you removed the learning section from the top nav the whole site is basically about shopping anyway, so highlighting those core use cases is better anyway IMO.

- [ ] 2. I wondered how often your data is updated. I've seen some manually curated sites for this sort of thing that feel out of date after a while, but if it's real-time you could reinforce this to build credibility with some copy or a little icon or banner or something.

- [-] 3. The information architecture feels off. Everything feels "big" and it feels very busy for a relatively consistent/small amount of information. I'd look at all of the ecommerce websites out there and follow their general styling (font size, font treatment, layout, etc.). I think it'd make it feel more familiar and easier to consume and navigate for someone browsing an array of products.

  - Partially addressed by adding the rankings area more as an experiment.

- [ ] 4. I bet there are some organic ways users might like to browse to your other sections even without using the top nav. You already have the "More GPUs" links at the bottom, but it took me a minute to find them. I just expected to be able to click on the header to get the full list.

- [ ] 5. I think there's an opportunity to educate users via the header of each section on the home page or even the sub-pages. Going to the Compare by FP16 TFLOPS page just gives me a list of products. I'm not really an expert in ML hardware but knowing why this is important at the top of the page helps anchor me on why I should care. You have this in your learning page, but I'd just surface this in-context, especially for a more casual browser or enthusiast.

I'm not really in your target demo, but just some thoughts!
