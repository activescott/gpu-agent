summary: >-
  The AMD Radeon Pro W7700 is a professional workstation graphics card launched in November 2023,
  featuring AMD's RDNA 3 architecture on the Navi 32 GPU. Built on TSMC's 5nm process with a
  chiplet design containing 28.1 billion transistors, the card features 48 compute units with
  3,072 stream processors and 96 AI Accelerators for enhanced machine learning performance.
  It includes 48 second-generation ray tracing accelerators and 16GB of GDDR6 memory with ECC
  support on a 256-bit bus, delivering 576 GB/s of bandwidth. The W7700 offers 31.95 TFLOPS
  of FP32 performance at a boost clock of 2,600 MHz. With a TDP of 190W and positioned at $999,
  this dual-slot card targets professional content creation, CAD, and AI workloads. It features
  four DisplayPort 2.1 outputs with UHBR 20 support providing up to 80 Gb/s of display link
  bandwidth, making it suitable for multi-display professional workflows.

notes:
  - FP32 TFLOPS of 31.95 calculated as 3,072 stream processors × 2,600 MHz boost clock × 2 ops/cycle = 31.95 TFLOPS
  - FP16 performance is 63.9 TFLOPS calculated at 2:1 ratio to FP32, which is standard for RDNA 3 architecture
  - tensorCoreCount of 96 represents the AI Accelerators (2 per compute unit × 48 compute units)
  - Memory bandwidth calculated as 256-bit bus × 18 Gbps effective = 576 GB/s
  - RDNA 3 architecture includes dedicated AI Accelerators for machine learning workloads
  - Built on TSMC 5nm process with chiplet design featuring Graphics Compute Die (GCD)
  - Includes ECC memory support for professional applications requiring data integrity
  - Released November 13, 2023 at $999 USD MSRP
  - Some sources report 28.27 TFLOPS FP32; 31.95 TFLOPS is peak at boost clock (2,600 MHz), while 28.27 TFLOPS may represent sustained performance at lower clocks
