# Marketing Coin Poet

Notes and plans related to marketing coinpoet...

A [beta list experience](https://quickpages.co/blog/launching-to-betalist-and-other-startup-directories) indicates that Betalist didn't disappoint as an early listing place. Their tips:

- Try to get as many likes on their tweet as possible (this will make you stand out).
- Share your BetaList listing with your followers and current users, but don’t ask them to like the listing (it’s against their terms).
- Retweet their tweet (this will help you with the last point by alerting your followers).

One hundred startup lists are at https://ninjaoutreach.com/startup-directories/ but they basically say that betalist is the best.
