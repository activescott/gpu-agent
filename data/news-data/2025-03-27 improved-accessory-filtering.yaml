title: "Enhanced Listing Filters to Remove Irrelevant Accessories"
content: |
  We've updated our platform to improve search results by removing irrelevant accessories. Our new filters eliminate listings for empty product boxes, generic cooling fans, and non-essential items that clutter product searches.

  These changes come directly from user feedback through our suggestion form. A big thank you to our community members who took the time to share their insights! Your input helps us make the platform better for everyone.

  We encourage more users to share their suggestions. If you have an idea to improve our marketplace, please fill out our feedback form. Your voice matters, and we're always listening.

  These changes remove about 5% of listings while making it easier for users to find exactly what they're looking for. Customers can now enjoy a more streamlined and focused shopping experience.
