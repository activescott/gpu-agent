summary: The NVIDIA H100 PCIe 80GB is a professional graphics card designed
  primarily for machine learning and high-performance computing applications.
  Launched in March 2023, it is built on the innovative Hopper GH100
  architecture and utilizes the 4 nm process by TSMC. The H100 PCIe 80GB stands
  out for its substantial memory capacity and high-speed memory bandwidth,
  making it exceptionally suitable for handling large datasets and complex
  machine learning models. Its tensor cores significantly accelerate machine
  learning operations. The Hopper architecture, as seen in the H100 and H200
  GPUs, introduces several technological innovations aimed at enhancing
  performance in AI training and inference. These GPUs are distinguished by
  their massive transistor count and advanced memory technologies, like HBM3 and
  HBM2e, supporting up to 80 GB of memory. The H100 supports HBM2e memory, while
  the H200 supports the faster HBM3 memory system, which can deliver up to 3
  TB/s, a significant increase over the previous generation's capabilities. A
  common nvidia part number for this card is 900-21010-000-000.
