title: "New GPU Filtering and Compare Page: Find Your Perfect GPU Faster"
content: |
  GPU Poet now features enhanced filtering across all ranking and price pages, plus a brand new [Compare GPU Prices](/gpu/price-compare) page that lets you browse every available GPU listing with powerful filters.

  ## Enhanced Filtering Everywhere

  All ranking and price-compare pages now support rich filtering options:

  ### Budget Filters
  Set a maximum price to only see GPUs within your budget. The filter updates results instantly, showing you exactly how many cards match your criteria.

  ### Memory Filters
  Filter by minimum VRAM capacity in gigabytes. Essential for AI workloads where model size is limited by GPU memory, or for gaming at high resolutions with texture packs.

  ### Memory Bandwidth
  Filter by minimum memory bandwidth (GB/s). High bandwidth matters for both AI inference throughput and high-refresh-rate gaming.

  ### TDP Filters
  Set a maximum power draw. Useful if you have PSU constraints or care about running costs and heat output.

  ### Gaming Benchmark Filters
  Even on AI ranking pages, you can now filter by gaming performance. Set a minimum FPS requirement for Counter-Strike 2, 3DMark Wildlife Extreme, or Quake II RTX, and the results will only show GPUs that meet both your AI specs and gaming requirements.

  ### Condition Filters (Price Pages)
  On price listing pages, filter by New, Used, or Refurbished condition to match your preferences.

  ### Series Filters
  Filter by GPU series (RTX 40, RTX 30, RX 7000, etc.) to narrow down to specific generations.

  ## URL-Based Filters

  All filter selections are saved in the URL. This means you can:
  - Bookmark filtered views for quick access later
  - Share specific filtered results with others
  - Use browser back/forward to navigate filter history

  ## How to Use It

  1. Visit any [ranking page](/gpu/ranking/gaming/counter-strike-2-fps-3840x2160) or the new [Compare GPU Prices](/gpu/price-compare) page
  2. Click "Filters" on mobile or use the sidebar on desktop
  3. Set your criteria using the sliders and dropdowns
  4. Results update automatically as you adjust filters
  5. The count shows how many GPUs match your current filters

  ## Example Use Cases

  **Budget Gaming Build**: Go to [Compare GPU Prices](/gpu/price-compare), set Budget to $300, Memory to at least 8GB, and filter by Counter-Strike 2 4K performance of at least 60 FPS.

  **AI Workstation with Gaming Capability**: Visit the [AI GPU Rankings](/gpu/ranking/ai/fp32-flops), filter for at least 24GB memory and at least 80 FPS in Counter-Strike 2 to find cards that handle both workloads.

  **Power-Efficient Options**: Set Max TDP to 200W to find GPUs that won't require a PSU upgrade or generate excessive heat.

  ## Navigation Updates

  The site navigation has also been reorganized to make these features easier to find:
  - Gaming GPU Rankings
  - Gaming GPU Prices
  - AI GPU Rankings
  - AI GPU Prices
  - Compare GPU Prices (new)
  - Learn

  The new layout groups gaming and AI options together and puts the new compare page front and center.

  ## The New Compare Page

  The [Compare GPU Prices](/gpu/price-compare) page shows all GPU listings from the marketplace in one place. Unlike the category-specific ranking pages, this page doesn't pre-filter by AI or gaming use case. Instead, you set the filters that matter to you and browse everything that matches.

  This is perfect when you're shopping with a budget in mind and want to see all options, or when you're flexible about whether you need a gaming card or an AI workstation GPU.

  ## What's Next

  These filtering capabilities lay the groundwork for more advanced comparison features. Future updates will include saved filter presets, comparison tables for side-by-side GPU analysis, and alerts when GPUs matching your criteria hit target prices.

  Try out the new [Compare GPU Prices](/gpu/price-compare) page and let us know what additional filters would help your GPU search.
