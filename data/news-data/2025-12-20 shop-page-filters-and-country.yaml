title: "GPU Shop Pages Now Have Filters + Country Filtering"
content: |
  Two filtering improvements are now live across GPU Poet.

  ## Filters on Individual GPU Shop Pages

  The individual GPU shop pages (like [NVIDIA RTX 3070](/gpu/shop/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070)) now include Budget and Condition filters. Previously, filtering was only available on the comparison pages. Now you can filter listings directly when shopping for a specific card.

  ## Country Filtering

  All listing pages now support filtering by seller location. If you prefer to buy from sellers in your country to avoid international shipping costs or delays, use the new Country filter to narrow results.

  ## More GPUs on Gaming Rankings

  GPUs with 8GB of memory (like the RTX 3070) now appear on gaming ranking pages. Previously, a 10GB memory threshold filtered them out. AI ranking pages still default to 10GB minimum, but you can adjust the Memory filter to see all cards.

  All filters work with URL persistence, so you can bookmark or share filtered views.
