summary: |
  The NVIDIA RTX 2000 Ada Generation is an entry-level professional workstation GPU released in February 2024,
  built on the Ada Lovelace architecture using the AD107 chip with TSMC's 4N custom process. It features 2,816 CUDA cores,
  88 fourth-generation Tensor Cores, and 22 third-generation RT Cores, paired with 16GB of GDDR6 ECC memory.
  The fourth-generation Tensor Cores introduce FP8 precision support and deliver 95.95 TOPS of dense INT8 performance (191.9 TOPS with sparsity), providing significant AI acceleration for professional workloads. With a TDP of only 70W and no
  external power connector required, the RTX 2000 Ada offers exceptional power efficiency in a compact dual-slot,
  low-profile form factor. The GPU delivers 12.0 TFLOPS of FP32 performance and 27.7 TFLOPS of RT Core performance.
  Memory bandwidth of 224 GB/s is provided through a 128-bit memory interface running at 14 Gbps effective speed.
  With PCI Express 4.0 x8 interface and four mini DisplayPort 1.4a outputs supporting up to 7680×4320 resolution
  at 60Hz, it's designed for professional visualization, CAD, 3D modeling, rendering, and AI/ML workloads in
  compact workstation environments.

notes:
  - FP32 TFLOPS of 12.0 sourced from NVIDIA official product page and confirmed by PNY product page.
  - Tensor performance of 191.9 TFLOPS represents peak FP8 tensor performance with sparsity.
  - FP16 TFLOPS of 95.9 represents Peak Sparse Tensor Core performance (calculated as half of FP8 Sparse performance). This metric is selected to align with the card's workstation AI capabilities.
  - 'int8TOPS of 95.95 represents non-sparse (dense) INT8 performance, derived from sparse INT8 of 191.9 TOPS ÷ 2 per NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture. With 2:4 structured sparsity, INT8 performance is 191.9 TOPS. Dense value used for consistent cross-vendor comparison.'
  - Memory bandwidth calculated as 128-bit interface × 14 Gbps ÷ 8 bits/byte = 224 GB/s.
  - CUDA Compute Capability 8.9 is standard for Ada Lovelace architecture workstation GPUs.
  - The GPU uses the AD107 chip with 22 of 24 SMs enabled, fabricated on TSMC 4N custom process.
  - TDP is 70W, no external power connector required.
  - MSRP of $625 USD positions it as the entry-level model in the Ada workstation lineup.
