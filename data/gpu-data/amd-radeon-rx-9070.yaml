summary: |
  The AMD Radeon RX 9070 is a high-performance graphics card released in March 2025,
  featuring the RDNA 4 architecture based on the Navi 48 GPU. It offers 56 compute units
  with 3,584 stream processors, 112 2nd-generation AI Accelerators, and 16GB of GDDR6 memory
  running at 20 Gbps. The card is designed for 1440p and 4K gaming, providing excellent
  performance with significantly lower power consumption (220W) compared to its XT sibling
  (304W). With a boost clock of 2.52 GHz, it delivers 36.1 TFLOPS of FP32 compute performance.
  The RX 9070 features 64MB of 3rd-generation Infinity Cache, 56 3rd-generation Ray Tracing
  accelerators, and supports FSR 4 (FidelityFX Super Resolution 4), AMD's machine-learning
  upscaling solution exclusive to RDNA 4. Built on TSMC's 4nm process using the Navi 48 die,
  the card is positioned to compete with NVIDIA's RTX 4070 and RTX 5070 at a starting price
  of $549. It uses a PCIe 5.0 x16 interface and offers 640 GB/s memory bandwidth on a
  256-bit bus, matching the RX 9070 XT's memory configuration.

notes:
  - tensorCoreCount tracks the 2nd-generation AI Accelerators as "tensor cores". The RX 9070 has 112 AI Accelerators (2 per CU × 56 CUs).
  - fp32TFLOPS of 36.1 calculated as 3,584 stream processors × 2.52 GHz boost clock × 2 (dual-issue) = 36.05 TFLOPS, rounded to 36.1.
  - fp16TFLOPS of 72.2 represents 2x FP32 performance due to packed FP16 operations support in RDNA 4.
  - Memory bandwidth calculated as 256-bit interface × 20 Gbps = 640 GB/s, enhanced by 64MB 3rd-generation Infinity Cache.
  - TDP is 220W, making it significantly more power-efficient than the RX 9070 XT (304W) while maintaining the same memory configuration.
  - Process node is TSMC 4nm with Navi 48 GPU die (same die as RX 9070 XT, but with 56 of 64 CUs enabled).
  - "Clock speeds: 2,070 MHz game clock and 2,520 MHz boost clock."
  - RDNA 4 introduces optimized Compute Units, 3rd-generation Ray Tracing accelerators, and 2nd-generation AI Accelerators.
  - FSR 4 is exclusive to RDNA 4 GPUs and leverages the AI accelerators for ML-based upscaling.
  - The RX 9070 offers exceptional efficiency, providing strong performance at lower power consumption compared to the XT variant, making it an attractive option for users prioritizing power efficiency.
  - The RX 9070 shares the same 16GB GDDR6 memory and 256-bit bus as the RX 9070 XT, differentiating primarily through reduced CU count and lower clocks.
  - MSRP of $549 USD sourced from AMD official announcement per GSMArena and Tom's Hardware coverage.
  - manufacturerIdentifiers is empty because AMD OPN (Ordering Part Number) codes for consumer GPUs are typically not published in consumer-facing documentation. These internal B2B identifiers are used for distribution/ordering purposes and are generally only available through AMD's B2B portals or internal documentation.
  - thirdPartyProducts includes verified AIB partner model numbers from Sapphire (11349-01-20G for NITRO+, 11349-03-20G for PULSE), XFX (RX-97SWFB3B9 for Swift OC), ASUS (TUF-RX9070-O16G-GAMING for TUF Gaming OC), ASRock (RX9070 CL 16G for Challenger, RX9070 SL 16G OC for Steel Legend OC), Gigabyte (GV-R9070GAMING-OC-16GD for Gaming OC), and PowerColor (RX9070 16G-L/OC for Hellhound). All model numbers verified from manufacturer product pages and retailer listings.
  - MSI does not appear to have released RX 9070 non-XT models as of the research date. MSI's current focus for AMD RDNA 4 appears to be on RX 9070 XT variants.
  - Gigabyte does not use their "Eagle" branding for AMD Radeon cards - the Eagle line is exclusive to NVIDIA GeForce products. For the RX 9070, Gigabyte offers Gaming OC and AORUS variants.
