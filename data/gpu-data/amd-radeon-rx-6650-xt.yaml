summary: >-
  The AMD Radeon RX 6650 XT was released in May 2022 as a refreshed mainstream gaming
  GPU based on the RDNA 2 architecture (Navi 23 KXT die). It features 32 compute units
  with 2,048 stream processors and 8GB of GDDR6 memory with faster 17.5 Gbps memory
  speed (compared to 16 Gbps on the RX 6600 XT), delivering 280 GB/s bandwidth on a
  128-bit bus. The card includes 32 ray tracing acceleration cores and 32MB of
  Infinity Cache. Built on TSMC's 7nm process with a 237 mm² die containing 11.06
  billion transistors, it delivers 10.79 TFLOPS of FP32 performance at a boost clock
  of 2,635 MHz. With a TDP of 176W (increased from 160W on the RX 6600 XT), the
  RX 6650 XT offers improved performance through higher clocks and faster memory
  while maintaining excellent 1080p gaming capabilities with DirectX 12 Ultimate
  support. It uses a PCIe 4.0 x8 interface.

notes:
  - FP32 TFLOPS calculated as 2,048 stream processors × 2,635 MHz boost clock × 2 ops/cycle / 1,000,000 = 10.79 TFLOPS
  - FP16 performance is 21.59 TFLOPS per TechPowerUp GPU Database (2:1 ratio to FP32, standard for RDNA 2 architecture)
  - Memory bandwidth of 280 GB/s calculated as 128-bit bus × 17.5 Gbps effective / 8
  - RDNA 2 architecture does not include dedicated AI accelerators or tensor cores (added in RDNA 3), so tensorCoreCount is null
  - RDNA 2 CUs support INT8 and INT4 data types and have INT8 matrix core support per ROCm documentation, but lack the WMMA (Wave Matrix Multiply Accumulate) instructions added in RDNA 3. AMD does not publish INT8 TOPS for consumer RDNA 2 GPUs, so int8TOPS is null. Sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDNA_2, https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/reference/precision-support.html
  - The 32MB Infinity Cache significantly improves effective memory bandwidth beyond the raw 280 GB/s specification
  - Built on TSMC 7nm process with 237 mm² die size containing 11.06 billion transistors
  - Released as a refresh of the RX 6600 XT with higher clocks (2,635 MHz vs 2,589 MHz boost), faster memory (17.5 Gbps vs 16 Gbps), and higher TDP (176W vs 160W)
  - Uses PCIe 4.0 x8 interface instead of x16
