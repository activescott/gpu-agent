summary: |
  The AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT is a mainstream graphics card released in May 2025,
  featuring the RDNA 4 architecture based on the Navi 44 GPU. It offers 32 compute units
  with 2,048 stream processors, 64 2nd-generation AI Accelerators, and 16GB of GDDR6 memory
  running at 20 Gbps. The card is designed for 1080p and 1440p gaming and provides enhanced
  AI/ML capabilities through RDNA 4's improved AI Accelerators. With a TDP of 160W and a
  boost clock reaching 3.32 GHz, it offers excellent performance per watt. The RX 9060 XT
  features 32MB of Infinity Cache, 32 3rd-generation Ray Tracing accelerators, and supports
  FSR 4 (FidelityFX Super Resolution 4), AMD's first machine-learning upscaling solution
  exclusive to RDNA 4. The card is positioned to compete with NVIDIA's RTX 4060 series
  and uses a PCIe 5.0 x16 interface. It's also available in an 8GB variant at a lower price point.

notes:
  - tensorCoreCount tracks the 2nd-generation AI Accelerators as "tensor cores". The RX 9060 XT has 64 AI Accelerators (2 per CU × 32 CUs).
  - fp32TFLOPS calculated as 2,048 stream processors × 3.32 GHz boost clock × 2 = 13.6 TFLOPS theoretical, but AMD publishes 25.6 TFLOPS likely accounting for RDNA 4's optimized dual-issue capabilities.
  - fp16TFLOPS of 51.3 represents 2x FP32 performance due to packed FP16 operations support in RDNA 4.
  - The RX 9060 XT features INT4 performance up to 821 TOPS, showcasing RDNA 4's enhanced AI capabilities.
  - Memory bandwidth calculated as 128-bit interface × 20 Gbps = 320 GB/s, with effective bandwidth enhanced by 32MB Infinity Cache.
  - TDP is 160W for the 16GB model.
  - Process node is TSMC 4nm with Navi 44 GPU die sized at 199mm².
  - The RX 9060 XT is available in both 16GB ($350) and 8GB ($300) configurations, with the 16GB variant offering better value for VRAM-intensive workloads.
  - RDNA 4 introduces 3rd-generation Ray Tracing accelerators and 2nd-generation AI Accelerators with optimized Compute Unit design.
  - FSR 4 is exclusive to RDNA 4 GPUs and leverages the new AI accelerators for ML-based upscaling.
