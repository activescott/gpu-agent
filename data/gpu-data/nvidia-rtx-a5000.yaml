notes:
  - "int8TOPS: INT8 TOPS is hard to find for this card. See the
    forums.developer.nvidia.com reference below: The INT8 TOPS performance of
    the RTX A5000 can be inferred from its Tensor performance specification. The
    card's Tensor performance is listed as 222.2 TFLOPS (Tera Floating-Point
    Operations Per Second). It's suggested that for INT8 calculations with
    sparsity, the performance should be double this number, meaning the INT8
    TOPS performance would be approximately 444.4 TOPS."
