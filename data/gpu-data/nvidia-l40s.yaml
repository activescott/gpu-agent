summary: The NVIDIA L40S GPU was introduced in August 2023 (part number
  900-2g133-0080-000). It is the successor to the NVIDIA L40 (part number
  900-2G133-0010-000) and like the L40 is based on the AD102 chip from the Ada
  Lovelace architecture. Compared with the L40 it has nearly double the TF32
  Tensor Core TFLOPS and FP16 Tensor Core performance, and increases the maximum
  power draw from 300W to 350W. It is targeted for generative AI and graphics
  and video applications. It lacks FP64 precision, but has great FP32, FP16 and
  mixed-precision performance. It uses the PCIe Gen4 x16 interconnect and Unlike
  the NVIDIA L4, it allows connecting monitors with 4x DisplayPort connectors.

  - "Estimated MSRP of $45,000 USD for the NVIDIA L40S based on OEM list prices. NVIDIA does not publish official MSRP for data center GPUs. OEM list prices corroborated by 2 independent sources: Lenovo ThinkSystem NVIDIA L40S (4X67A90669) has MSRP of $51,579 per multioculus.com, and Cisco UCSX-GPU-L40S has MSRP of $39,094.50 per Bluum. The $45,000 estimate represents the midpoint of these OEM list prices. Note: Current market/resale prices (~$7,500) are significantly lower due to depreciation but do not reflect original launch list pricing."
