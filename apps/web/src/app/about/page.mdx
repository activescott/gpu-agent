I'm Scott Willeke, the software engineer who built this site as a personal project. You can learn more about me at [scott.willeke.com](https://scott.willeke.com).

This started years ago when I was buying and selling GPUs for cryptocurrency mining. I got frustrated with how hard it was to compare actual value across different cards when prices were changing constantly and specs only told part of the story. So I built something to solve that problem for myself.

Fast forward to the AI boom, and the same problem came back. Everyone wanted to know which GPU gave the best performance per dollar for machine learning workloads, but nobody was combining real performance data with current marketplace prices. Over the years off and on I've accumulated dozens or hundreds of hours building this over the years because the problem is interesting and the data genuinely useful.

There's no company behind this, no VC funding, no grand plan to build an empire. Just me, some open data, eBay's API, and a lot of time spent wrangling GPU specs and benchmark results into something actually helpful.

More recently, the site gathers rigorous benchmark data for GPUs and AI accelerators, then breaks down price by performance metrics so you can see what you're actually getting for your money. No back-orders or phantom inventory. Every product listed is available for purchase right now.

The site is free to use and doesn't require registration. When you click a link to a product and buy something, it may generate a small affiliate fee at no cost to you. That's how I cover hosting and ongoing maintenance costs. Thanks for using the site.

If you have questions, feedback, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out on the [contact page](/contact).
