summary: >-
  The AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT was unveiled in August, 2023 as one of the GPUs
  using the new RDNA 3 architecture. It includes RDNA 3 architecture's new AI
  Accelerators which accelerate the GEMM operations that are critical to machine
  learning/AI performance. 
      With 60 compute units (CUs) and 120 AI Accelerators, it has lower compute capacity compared to the 7900 XTX's 96 CUs and 192 AI Accelerators, but the RDNA 3 architecture's AI Accelerators make it a contender among AMD GPUs for AI/machine learning.
      Some common models of this card are the PowerColor RX7800XT 16G-E/OC (B0CFPSX77R), the ASRock RX7800XT CL 16GO (B0CHK3929K), Gigabyte GV-R78XTGAMING OC-16GD (B0CGHQ32S2), and Sapphire 11330-03-20G (B0CFWRLDB5). 
      The lowest price for all of these is tracked and continuously updated below.
