## Arbitration and Opt Out

We'd like to resolve any disputes fairly and quickly. Toward that end, if
you have any issue with Ping Poet Products, please contact us and we'll work
with you in good faith to try to resolve the matter.

If we can't solve the dispute informally, and if you are a resident of or have your principal place of business in the United States or Canada, you and Ping Poet Products agree to resolve any claim against each other through final and binding arbitration, including claims against Ping Poet Products affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents, and Ping Poet Products affiliates' officers, directors, employees and agents.

You and Ping Poet Products agree to submit the dispute to a single arbitrator under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) including the Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, or, by separate mutual agreement, to another arbitration institution. The AAA's rules and a description of the arbitration process are available at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org). The location of the arbitration and the allocation of fees and costs shall be determined under the AAA rules, except that Ping Poet Products will reimburse you for all AAA administrative fees in disputes that are subject to the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, unless the arbitrator determines that a claim or counterclaim was filed for purposes of harassment or is patently frivolous.

The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration,
reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other
witnesses.
The Federal Arbitration Act governs all disputes between you and Ping Poet Products.
The arbitrator will decide whether a dispute can be arbitrated.
If you opt out of the arbitration agreement (as provided below), or if the
arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, or if you neither are a
resident nor have a principal place of business in the United States or
Canada, you agree to resolve any claim you have with Ping Poet Products
exclusively in a state or federal court located in the County of King County
Washington, and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located
in the County of King County, Washington for purpose of litigating all such
disputes.
Nothing shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief
from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property, or
unauthorized access to the services.
To the extent permitted by law, you agree to file any claim you may have
against Ping Poet Products within one year after such claim arose. Otherwise,
your claim is permanently barred.

## Class Action and Trial Waiver

You and Ping Poet Products agree that each may bring disputes against the
other only in an individual capacity and not on behalf of any class of people.
You and Ping Poet Products agree not to participate in a class action, a
class-wide arbitration, claims brought in a representative capacity, or
consolidated claims involving another person's account. You and Ping Poet
Products agree not to combine a claim subject to arbitration under this
agreement with a claim that is not eligible for arbitration under this
agreement. You and Ping Poet Products agree to waive the right to a trial by
jury for all disputes.

## Your Right to Opt Out of Arbitration

You may opt out of the agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor
Ping Poet Products can require the other to participate in an arbitration
proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Ping Poet Products within 90 days of
the date that you first agreed to these Terms. To opt out, sending an email
to: legal@pingpoet.com with your written opt-out notice. Your written opt-out
notice must include (1) your name and residence address; (2) the email address
(or phone number if email address is not available) associated with your
account; (3) a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration
agreement; (4) date sent, and (5) your signature.

## Governing Law and Jurisdiction

These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of Washington, except
for its conflict of laws principles.
For claims that aren't subject to arbitration, we each agree to submit to
the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in King County, Washington or
in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington.

## Entire Agreement

These Terms, our [Privacy Policy](/policy/privacy), and our
[Payment and Refunds page](/policy/payments) constitute the entire
agreement between you and Ping Poet Products. If any provision of these Terms
is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these Terms will
remain in full force and effect.

## No Waiver

No waiver of any provision of these Terms shall be a further or continuing
waiver of that term. Ping Poet Products' failure to assert any right or
provision under these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that right or
provision.

## Modification

The Terms may be modified from time to time. The date of the most recent
revisions will always be at https://stockpoet.pingpoet.com/policy/terms. You'll
agree to accept any changes or revisions to the Terms by continuing to use Ping
Poet Products offerings.
