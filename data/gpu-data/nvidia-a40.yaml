notes:
  - "Estimated MSRP of $27,500 USD for the NVIDIA A40 based on OEM list prices. NVIDIA does not publish official MSRP for data center GPUs. OEM list prices corroborated by 2 independent sources: Cisco UCSC-GPU-A40 has list price of $27,561.22 per Hummingbird Networks, and Lenovo ThinkSystem A40 (4X67A72593) is listed at €26,526.32 (~$28,500 USD) per Redcorp. Note: Current market/resale prices (~$5,500) are significantly lower due to depreciation but do not reflect original launch list pricing."
