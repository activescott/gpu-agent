# About Machine Learning Model RetinaNet

RetinaNet is a state-of-the-art one-stage object detector, recognized for its performance comparable to classical two-stage approaches like Faster R-CNN, while being computationally more efficient. This model was introduced as part of a study focusing on a novel loss function named Focal Loss, designed to address the class imbalance problem in object detection tasks. The introduction of Focal Loss, which concentrates training on a sparse set of difficult examples and mitigates the overwhelming effect of numerous easy negatives, is a significant feature of RetinaNet. This approach was a breakthrough in object detection, allowing RetinaNet to achieve high accuracy more efficiently compared to prior methods.
