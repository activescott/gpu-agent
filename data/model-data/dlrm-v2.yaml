summary: |
  Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM) is a neural network-based model designed for personalization and recommendation systems. It uniquely processes categorical data through embeddings and dense features using a multilayer perceptron (MLP), addressing the challenges of handling categorical features in recommendation tasks. DLRM includes a specialized parallelization scheme for optimizing memory usage and computational efficiency in large-scale deployments.
