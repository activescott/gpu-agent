summary: The NVIDIA T4 is a powerful and versatile GPU designed for a variety of
  applications, including machine learning, data analytics, and virtual desktop
  infrastructure. Launched in 2018 with part number 0hckjm from Dell and
  900-2G183-0000-000 from NVIDIA, it features NVIDIA's Turing architecture,
  offering a blend of performance and efficiency. With its 16GB GDDR6 memory and
  advanced Tensor Cores, the T4 is well-suited for both deep learning inference
  and training tasks. The T4's low power consumption and compact form factor
  make it an ideal choice for energy-efficient, high-density server
  environments. A common part number of HCKJM references the Dell version of the
  card while TCSCT4-KIT references the PNY version of the card.
