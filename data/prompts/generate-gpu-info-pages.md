You are a Machine Learning expert and analytical blogger that writes interesting articles that software engineers and Data Scientists like to read.

You will be researching a set of cards that will each be either a Machine Learning Accelerator or GPU.

Research the following cards:

- nvidia a10-pci-24gb
- nvidia a30

First, for each card identify the following information:

- **GPU Architecture**: [The design and model of the GPU/accelerator]
- **Memory Size**: [Amount of onboard memory, usually measured in GB. You may also see this described as "DRAM".]
- **Memory Bandwidth**: [The rate at which data can be read from or stored into a memory by the GPU, measured in GB/s]
- **Tensor Cores**: [the number tensor cores]
- **GPU Clock Rate**: [speed at which the GPU's core operates, usually measured or GHz or MHz]
- **Max Power Consumption**: [The maximum amount of power consumed by the card, measured in watts]
- **FP32 TFLOPS**: [Floating point 32 performance, usually measured in TFLOPS. You may also see this described as "FP32 (float)" or "single precision performance"]

For your research only visit links from the following domains:

- nvidia.com
- qualcomm.com
- habana.ai
- intel.com
- techpowerup.com
- topcpu.net
- videocardz.net
- anandtech.com
- tomshardware.com

Now, output the information you identified and output the list of URL links to the sources where you found that information. Use only the web sites you visited as sources. Do not list sources from your training.

Stop and ask me for before continuing.

Once I say to continue, for each of the cards create a separate markdown document according to the following requirements:

- A heading at the top like `[card name] Machine Learning [Accelerator or GPU]`
- A several sentence paragraph describing the card, its performance or applicability to machine learning inference and/or training, when it was created and what is or was novel about the model.
- Include a "Specifications" section as follows:
  - **GPU Architecture**: [The design and model of the GPU/accelerator]
  - **Memory Size**: [Amount of onboard memory, usually measured in GB]
  - **Memory Bandwidth**: [The rate at which data can be read from or stored into a memory by the GPU, measured in GB/s]
  - **Tensor Cores**: [the number tensor cores]
  - **GPU Clock Rate**: [speed at which the GPU's core operates, usually measured or GHz or MHz]
  - **Max Power Consumption**: [The maximum amount of power consumed by the card, measured in watts]
  - **FP32 TFLOPS**: [Floating point 32 performance, usually measured in TFLOPS]
- Include a References section at the end that lists the sources you used for [card name] that you outputted earlier. Before providing the URL, visit it and verify that it is valid. If it is a valid URL, use it in the output document. If it is not valid, provide a link to a specific duckduckgo search that is likely to return the source instead of the URL.
- Include a few

NOTE: If you do not have high confidence on a value then use the placeholder "[More Information Needed]".
