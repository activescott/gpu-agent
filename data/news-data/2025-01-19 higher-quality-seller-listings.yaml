title: "GPU Price Verification with High-Quality Seller Requirement"
content: |
  We've implemented an update to enhance the quality of GPU listings on Coin Poet. This change comes after a customer reported a suspiciously underpriced listing that could potentially mislead our users.

  For example, we recently spotted a listing for an [NVIDIA Tesla H100 80GB PCIe GPU](https://coinpoet.com/ml/shop/gpu/nvidia-h100-pcie) priced at $879 (a GPU that typically sells for around $20,000). Upon investigating, this came from a new seller with no transaction history.

  To ensure more reliable pricing data, we've implemented new seller quality filters:
  - Only including listings from sellers with >90% positive feedback
  - Removing listings from sellers with no transaction history
  - Maintaining higher quality price tracking data

  This update filters approximately 8% of total listings but significantly improves the reliability of our price tracking. You can now [view prices for the best GPUs for the money](https://coinpoet.com/ml/shop/gpu) with greater confidence knowing that listings come from established sellers with proven track records.
