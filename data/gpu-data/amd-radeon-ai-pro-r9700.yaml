summary: |
  The AMD Radeon AI PRO R9700 is a professional AI workstation GPU released on July 23, 2025,
  built on AMD's RDNA 4 architecture using the Navi 48 GPU die manufactured on TSMC's 4nm process.
  Featuring 64 compute units with 4,096 stream processors and 128 second-generation AI Accelerators,
  the card is designed for local AI inference, model fine-tuning, and complex creative workloads.
  It includes 32GB of high-speed GDDR6 memory on a 256-bit interface running at 20 Gbps, delivering
  640 GB/s of memory bandwidth. The GPU delivers 47.8 TFLOPS of FP32 performance and 96 TFLOPS of FP16
  (Half-Precision) performance, with clock speeds ranging from 1,620 MHz base to 2,920 MHz boost
  (game clock of 2,350 MHz). The 2nd-generation AI Accelerators support FP8, FP16, and INT8 precisions
  with sparsity acceleration enabling up to 4× FP16 and 8× INT8 throughput for AI workloads, reaching
  up to 1,531 TOPS of INT4 sparse AI performance. The card features a compact dual-slot design with
  a blower-style cooling solution and a 300W TDP, using PCIe 5.0 connectivity for maximum bandwidth.
  AMD positions this as their flagship AI workstation GPU, fully compatible with the ROCm open software
  platform with support for PyTorch, ONNX Runtime, and TensorFlow frameworks. Display connectivity
  includes four DisplayPort 2.1 outputs. Available initially in SI-built workstation systems from
  Boxx and Velocity Micro, with standalone cards from ASRock, ASUS, Gigabyte, PowerColor, Sapphire,
  XFX, and Yeston available later in Q3 2025. Priced at $1,299 USD, it targets AI developers, data
  scientists, and creative professionals who need substantial local AI inference capability.

notes:
  - MSRP of $1,299 USD sourced from AMD official blog post and retail listings. Available July 23, 2025 in SI-built systems, with standalone cards from board partners available later in Q3 2025.
  - FP32 TFLOPS of 47.8 calculated as 4,096 stream processors × 2,920 MHz boost clock × 4 ops/cycle (dual-issue) ÷ 1,000,000 = 47.8 TFLOPS. RDNA 4 architecture features dual-issue FP32 capability, effectively doubling shader throughput compared to single-issue designs.
  - FP16 TFLOPS of 96 represents Peak Half-Precision performance as specified by AMD. RDNA 4 AI Accelerators provide 2:1 FP16 to FP32 performance ratio on AI-focused operations.
  - INT8 TOPS of 192 is estimated based on 2:1 INT8 to FP16 ratio typical for RDNA 4 architecture. AMD publishes up to 1,531 TOPS for INT4 sparse AI performance with sparsity acceleration enabled.
  - tensorCoreCount of 128 represents the 2nd-generation AI Accelerators (2 per compute unit × 64 compute units), which are AMD's dedicated matrix multiplication units for AI workloads.
  - Memory bandwidth calculated as 256-bit interface × 20 Gbps ÷ 8 bits/byte = 640 GB/s, confirmed by AMD specifications.
  - RDNA 4 architecture includes redesigned 3rd-generation Ray Tracing Accelerators and 2nd-generation AI Accelerators with support for sparsity acceleration.
  - Supported hardware operations include FP8, FP16, BF16, INT8, and INT4 on AI Accelerators, with FP32 operations on general shader units. Sparsity acceleration enables up to 4× FP16 and 8× INT8 throughput.
  - The GPU uses the Navi 48 GPU die manufactured on TSMC's 4nm process with 64 Compute Units.
