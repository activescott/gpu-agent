summary: >-
  The AMD Radeon RX 7600 XT was unveiled in January, 2024 as one of the GPUs
  using the new RDNA 3 architecture. It includes RDNA 3 architecture's new AI
  Accelerators which accelerate the GEMM operations that are critical to machine
  learning/AI performance. 
      With 32 compute units (CUs) and 64 AI Accelerators, it has significantly lower compute capacity compared to the 7900 XTX's 96 CUs and 192 AI Accelerators, but the RDNA 3 architecture's AI Accelerators and it's lower price make it a consideration among AMD GPUs for AI/machine learning.
