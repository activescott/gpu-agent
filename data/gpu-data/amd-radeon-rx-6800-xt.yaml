summary: >-
  The AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT was released in November 2020 as AMD's high-end gaming GPU
  based on the RDNA 2 architecture (Navi 21 XT). It features 72 compute units with 4,608
  stream processors and 16GB of GDDR6 memory with 512 GB/s bandwidth. The card includes
  72 ray tracing acceleration cores and 128MB of Infinity Cache to boost effective memory
  bandwidth. Built on TSMC's 7nm process with 26.8 billion transistors, it delivers
  20.74 TFLOPS of FP32 performance at a boost clock of 2,250 MHz. With a TDP of 300W,
  the RX 6800 XT was designed to compete with NVIDIA's RTX 3080, offering strong 4K
  gaming performance and DirectX 12 Ultimate support including hardware-accelerated
  ray tracing and variable rate shading.

notes:
  - FP16 performance is 41.47 TFLOPS calculated at 2:1 ratio to FP32, which is standard for RDNA 2 architecture
  - FP32 TFLOPS calculated as 4,608 stream processors × 2,250 MHz boost clock × 2 ops/cycle = 20.74 TFLOPS
  - Memory bandwidth calculated as 256-bit bus × 16 Gbps effective = 512 GB/s
  - RDNA 2 architecture does not include dedicated AI/ML accelerators or tensor cores
  - The 128MB Infinity Cache significantly improves effective memory bandwidth beyond the raw 512 GB/s specification
  - Built on TSMC 7nm process with 520 mm² die size containing 26.8 billion transistors
  - MSRP of $649 USD verified from multiple sources including Tom's Guide, Wikipedia, and VideoCardz at launch on November 18, 2020
