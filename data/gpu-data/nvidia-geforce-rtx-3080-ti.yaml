summary: |
  The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is a flagship-class graphics card released in June 2021,
  featuring the Ampere architecture based on the GA102 GPU. It offers 10,240 CUDA cores,
  320 3rd-generation tensor cores, and 12GB of GDDR6X memory running at 19 Gbps, delivering
  546 AI TOPS for INT8 workloads with sparsity. The card was positioned between the RTX 3080
  and RTX 3090, offering RTX 3090-level gaming performance with less VRAM (12GB vs 24GB).
  With a TDP of 350W, it provides exceptional performance for both 4K gaming and demanding
  machine learning workloads including training and inference. The RTX 3080 Ti uses a
  PCI-Express 4.0 x16 interface and features 912 GB/s memory bandwidth on a 384-bit bus,
  matching the RTX 3090's memory subsystem.

notes:
  - fp16TFLOPS of 136.40 represents "Peak FP16 Tensor TFLOPS" using the "with sparsity" metric. Dense performance is 68.20 TFLOPS, sparse is 136.40 TFLOPS. Following Ampere architecture standards, NVIDIA publishes sparse tensor performance.
  - int8TOPS of 545.59 is "peak INT8 TOPS" using "Effective TOPS using the Sparsity Feature". Dense performance is 272.79 TOPS, sparse is 545.59 TOPS.
  - fp32TFLOPS calculated as 10,240 CUDA cores × 1.665 GHz boost clock × 2 ops/cycle = 34.10 TFLOPS. Ampere architecture features 2 FP32 ops per cycle through dedicated FP32 datapath and shared INT32/FP32 datapath.
  - Power based on what NVIDIA refers to as "TGP (Total Graphics Power)".
  - The RTX 3080 Ti uses the GA102-225 variant of the GA102 chip with 80 of 84 streaming multiprocessors enabled, same as RTX 3090 but with hash rate limiter for cryptocurrency mining.
  - Memory bandwidth calculated as 384-bit interface × 19 Gbps = 912 GB/s.
  - Process node is Samsung 8nm with approximately 28.3 billion transistors.
  - The RTX 3080 Ti shares the same GPU die and memory configuration as the RTX 3090, differing primarily in VRAM capacity (12GB vs 24GB).
