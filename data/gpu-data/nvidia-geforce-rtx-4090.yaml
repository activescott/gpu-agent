summary: |
  The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 is a graphics card released in 2022,
  featuring the latest Ada Lovelace architecture based on the AD102 GPU, the
  most powerful GPU based on the NVIDIA Ada architecture. While primarily aimed
  at gamers, the RTX 4090 also offers impressive capabilities for machine
  learning tasks, particularly inference and training workloads that benefit
  from its large memory and high core count. It uses a PCI-Express 4.0 x16 host
  interface.

notes:
  - fp16TFLOPS is "Peak FP16 Tensor TFLOPS with FP16 Accumulate" as that's what NVIDIA publishes. Using the "with sparsity" metric.
  - int8TOPS of 1321.2 is "peak INT 8 TOPS" using "Effective TOPS / TFLOPS using the new Sparsity Feature". They also reveal it as 660.6 "based on GPU Boost Clock". This comes from the ada-gpu-architecture-whitepaper-v2.1.
  - Power based on what NVIDIA refers to as "TGP (Total Graphics Power)"
