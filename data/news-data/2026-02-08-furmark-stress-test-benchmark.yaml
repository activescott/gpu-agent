title: "New Benchmark: FurMark GPU Stress Test Data Added"
content: |
  We've added FurMark (GL) benchmark data to GPU Poet at three resolutions: [1080p](/gpu/ranking/gaming/furmark-gl-fps-1920x1080), [1440p](/gpu/ranking/gaming/furmark-gl-fps-2560x1440), and [4K](/gpu/ranking/gaming/furmark-gl-fps-3840x2160).

  FurMark is a GPU stress test by Geeks3D that renders a fur-covered torus with heavy fragment shading using OpenGL. Unlike burst-oriented gaming benchmarks, it sustains maximum GPU load, so it shows how cards handle thermals and power delivery over time. Useful if you're playing demanding high-resolution games, evaluating used hardware, or testing overclock stability.

  ## The Data

  Benchmark scores come from [gpumagick.com](https://gpumagick.com) community submissions — over 10,000 samples at 1080p, ~5,000 at 1440p, and 1,300+ at 4K. Since it runs on OpenGL, NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel GPUs all run the same code path, making cross-vendor comparisons straightforward.

  The rankings cover 150+ GPU models at 1080p and 65+ at 4K, from current RTX 50-series and RX 9000-series cards down to older hardware.

  ## Rankings
