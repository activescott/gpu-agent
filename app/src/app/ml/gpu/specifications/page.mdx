# Technical Specifications Relevant for Machine Learning Accelerators and GPUs

The technical specifications that are typically crucial for evaluating machine learning accelerators and GPUs include:

- **GPU Architecture**: The design and model of the GPU.
- **Memory Size**: Amount of onboard memory, usually measured in GB.
- **Memory Bandwidth**: The rate at which data can be read from or stored into a memory by the GPU, measured in GB/s.
- **Tensor Cores**: Specialized cores for accelerating deep learning tasks.
- **GPU Clock Rate**: The speed at which the GPU's core operates, measured in MHz or GHz.
- **Max Power Consumption**: The maximum amount of power consumed by the card, measured in watts.
- **FP32 Performance**: Floating point 32 performance, indicating the GPU's efficiency in handling 32-bit floating-point operations. Measured in teraflops (TFLOPS)
- **Compute Performance**: Indicates the overall computational power. Measured in teraflops (TFLOPS).
