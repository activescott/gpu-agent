summary: |
  The Intel Arc Pro B50 is a compact, power-efficient workstation GPU released on September 3, 2025, built on Intel's Xe2
  (Battlemage) architecture using TSMC's 5nm process. It features 16 Xe cores, 128 XMX (Xe Matrix Extension) engines for
  AI acceleration, and 16 dedicated ray tracing units, with 19.6 billion transistors on a 272mm² die. The GPU delivers
  10.65 TFLOPS of FP32 compute performance and 21.3 TFLOPS of FP16 performance, paired with 16GB of GDDR6 memory on a
  128-bit interface running at 14 Gbps for 224 GB/s of memory bandwidth. With a remarkably low 70W TBP (Total Board Power),
  the Arc Pro B50 requires no external power connectors and draws power entirely from the PCIe slot, making it ideal for
  compact workstations and SFF (Small Form Factor) systems. The card ships with both standard and low-profile I/O brackets
  in a dual-slot form factor. The 128 XMX engines deliver up to 170 TOPS of INT8 AI performance, supporting multiple
  precision formats including FP16, BF16, INT8, INT4, and INT2 for AI inference and machine learning workloads. The XMX
  units support matrix operations with FP16 and BF16 multiply operations with either 16-bit or 32-bit accumulation,
  providing flexibility for various AI and professional applications. Clock speeds range from 1700 MHz base to 2600 MHz
  boost, and the GPU supports PCIe 5.0 x8 interface. Display connectivity includes four DisplayPort 2.1 outputs with UHBR
  13.5 support, capable of driving up to four displays at resolutions up to 7680x4320 (8K) at 60Hz. The card supports
  modern APIs including DirectX 12 Ultimate, Vulkan 1.4, OpenGL 4.6, and OpenCL 3.0, along with Intel's oneAPI, OpenVINO,
  XeSS upscaling technology, and PyTorch IPEX extension for AI/ML frameworks. Announced at Computex 2025 in May with an
  initial MSRP target of $299, the final launch price was adjusted to $349 due to memory pricing and tariff considerations,
  with Intel offsetting the price increase by enhancing performance specifications. Available through Intel-authorized
  resellers starting September 2025, the Arc Pro B50 targets entry-level professional workstation users in fields like
  3D rendering, video editing, CAD, and AI development, offering exceptional power efficiency and compact form factor at
  an accessible price point.
