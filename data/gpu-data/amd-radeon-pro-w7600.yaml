summary: >-
  The AMD Radeon Pro W7600 is a professional workstation graphics card launched on August 3, 2023,
  featuring AMD's RDNA 3 architecture on the Navi 33 GPU. Built on TSMC's 6nm process as a
  monolithic die containing 13.3 billion transistors across 204 mm², the card features 32 compute
  units with 2,048 stream processors and 64 AI Accelerators for enhanced machine learning performance.
  It includes 32 second-generation ray tracing accelerators and 8GB of GDDR6 memory on a 128-bit bus,
  delivering 288 GB/s of bandwidth with 32MB of AMD Infinity Cache. The W7600 offers 21.4 TFLOPS of
  peak FP32 performance and 42.8 TFLOPS of peak FP16 performance. With a TDP of
  130W and positioned at $599, this single-slot card targets mainstream professional content creation,
  CAD, and engineering workflows. It features four DisplayPort 2.1 outputs with UHBR 20 support
  providing up to 80 Gb/s of display link bandwidth, making it suitable for multi-display professional
  workflows up to 8K resolution. The card requires a single 6-pin PCIe power connector and uses a
  PCIe 4.0 x8 interface.

notes:
  - 'FP32 TFLOPS of 21.4 sourced from AMD''s official product page "Peak Single Precision" specification. Note: Earlier press materials stated 20.0 TFLOPS; currently selected value reflects the final product page peak spec despite discrepancies with launch documentation.'
  - FP16 TFLOPS of 42.8 calculated at 2:1 ratio to FP32 peak performance, which is standard for RDNA 3 architecture.
  - tensorCoreCount of 64 represents the AI Accelerators (2 per compute unit × 32 compute units), consistent with RDNA 3 architecture
  - Memory bandwidth calculated as 128-bit bus × 18 Gbps effective = 288 GB/s, confirmed by multiple sources
  - RDNA 3 architecture includes dedicated AI Accelerators supporting Wave Matrix Multiply Accumulate (WMMA) operations for machine learning workloads
  - RDNA 3 AI Accelerators support FP16, BF16, INT8, and INT4 data types for matrix operations
  - Built on TSMC 6nm (N6) process as a monolithic die (not chiplet design like Navi 31/32)
  - Navi 33 die specifications - 204 mm² die size, 13.3 billion transistors
  - Released August 3, 2023 at $599 USD MSRP per AMD official press release
  - MSRP of $599 USD sourced from AMD official press release dated August 3, 2023
  - AMD Ordering Part Number (OPN) 100-300000077 sourced from multiple retailers including B&H Photo, Amazon, Newegg, and Micro Center
  - UPC 727419314855 and EAN 0727419314855 are retail product codes documented for reference only
  - Dell part number 490-BJZF sourced from Dell.com official product page
  - HP part number 8D6B9AA sourced from HP channel partners
  - int8TOPS is null because AMD does not publish separate INT8 TOPS specifications for RDNA 3 workstation GPUs; INT8 is supported via AI Accelerators but runs at same speed as FP16
  - Card features 32MB AMD Infinity Cache for improved memory performance
  - Single-slot design with blower-style cooler, requires single 6-pin PCIe power connector
  - PCIe 4.0 x8 interface (not x16)
