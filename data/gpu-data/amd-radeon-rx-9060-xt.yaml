summary: |
  The AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT is a mainstream graphics card released in May 2025,
  featuring the RDNA 4 architecture based on the Navi 44 GPU. It offers 32 compute units
  with 2,048 stream processors, 64 2nd-generation AI Accelerators, and 16GB of GDDR6 memory
  running at 20 Gbps. The card is designed for 1080p and 1440p gaming and provides enhanced
  AI/ML capabilities through RDNA 4's improved AI Accelerators. With a TDP of 160W and a
  boost clock reaching 3.32 GHz, it offers excellent performance per watt. The RX 9060 XT
  features 32MB of Infinity Cache, 32 3rd-generation Ray Tracing accelerators, and supports
  FSR 4 (FidelityFX Super Resolution 4), AMD's first machine-learning upscaling solution
  exclusive to RDNA 4. The card is positioned to compete with NVIDIA's RTX 4060 series
  and uses a PCIe 5.0 x16 interface. It's also available in an 8GB variant at a lower price point.
