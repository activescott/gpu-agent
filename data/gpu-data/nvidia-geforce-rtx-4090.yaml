summary: |
  The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 is a graphics card released in 2022,
  featuring the Ada Lovelace architecture based on the AD102 GPU, the most
  powerful GPU based on the NVIDIA Ada architecture. The set of retail cards in
  the NVIDIA RTX 40-series cards is RTX 4090, RTX 4080 SUPER, RTX 4080, RTX 4070
  Ti SUPER, RTX 4070 Ti, RTX 4070 SUPER, RTX 4070, RTX 4060 Ti, and the RTX
  4060. While primarily aimed at gamers, the RTX 4090 also offers impressive
  capabilities for machine learning tasks, particularly inference and training
  workloads that benefit from its large memory and high core count. It uses a
  PCI-Express 4.0 x16 host interface.

notes:
  - MSRP of $1599 USD sourced from NVIDIA's official announcement. A Founders Edition was available at this price. Due to high demand and limited availability, most RTX 4090 cards are priced between $1,700 and $2,000 or higher.
  - fp16TFLOPS is "Peak FP16 Tensor TFLOPS with FP16 Accumulate" as that's what NVIDIA publishes. Using the "with sparsity" metric.
  - int8TOPS is "peak INT 8 TOPS" using "Effective TOPS / TFLOPS using the new Sparsity Feature". They also reveal it as 660.6 "based on GPU Boost Clock". This comes from the ada-gpu-architecture-whitepaper-v2.1.
  - Power based on what NVIDIA refers to as "TGP (Total Graphics Power)"
