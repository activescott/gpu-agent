# GPU Spec Metric Definitions
# These metrics represent hardware specifications that are extracted from GPU spec YAML files
metrics:
  - slug: tensor-cores
    name: Tensor Core Count
    category: ai
    metricType: spec
    unit: Tensor Cores
    unitShortest: Cores
    description: Tensor Cores are processors that perform efficient matrix multiplication, and are very useful for deep neural networks.
    descriptionDollarsPer: How much you pay per tensor core. Lower is better.
    gpuField: tensorCoreCount

  - slug: fp32-flops
    name: FP32 TFLOPs
    category: ai
    metricType: spec
    unit: FP32 TFLOPs
    unitShortest: TFLOPs
    description: The number of 32-bit floating-point operations per second the card can perform in trillions.
    descriptionDollarsPer: Dollars per 32-bit floating-point operations per second indicates how much you pay for each trillion operations per second. Lower is better.
    gpuField: fp32TFLOPS

  - slug: fp16-flops
    name: FP16 TFLOPs
    category: ai
    metricType: spec
    unit: FP16 TFLOPs

    category: ai
    metricType: spec
    unit: Int8 TOPs
    unitShortest: TOPs
    description: The number of 8-bit operations per second the card can perform in trillions.
    descriptionDollarsPer: Dollars per 8-bit integer operations per second indicates how much you pay for each trillion operations per second. Lower is better.
    gpuField: int8TOPS

  - slug: memory-gb
    name: Memory Capacity (GB)
    category: ai
    metricType: spec
    unit: GB
    unitShortest: GB
    description: The amount of memory the card has in gigabytes.
    descriptionDollarsPer: Dollars-per-gigabyte is how much you pay for each GB of memory capacity. Lower is better.
    gpuField: memoryCapacityGB

  - slug: memory-bandwidth-gbs
    name: Memory Bandwidth (GB/s)
    category: ai
    metricType: spec
    unit: GB/s
    unitShortest: GB/s
    description: The rate that data can be transferred between memory and the processor in gigabytes per second.
    descriptionDollarsPer: Dollars-per-gigabyte per-second is how much you're pay for each GBs of memory bandwidth. Lower is better.
    gpuField: memoryBandwidthGBs
