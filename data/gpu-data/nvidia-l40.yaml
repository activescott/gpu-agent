summary: The NVIDIA L40 GPU was introduced in September 2022 with part number
  900-2G133-0010-000. It is based on the AD102 chip from the Ada Lovelace
  architecture. It is optimized for graphics and AI-enabled 2D, video and 3D
  image generation. It uses the PCIe Gen4 x16 interconnect and Unlike the NVIDIA
  L4, it allows connecting monitors with 4x DisplayPort connectors.
