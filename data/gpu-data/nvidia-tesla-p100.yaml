summary: The NVIDIA Tesla P100 was announced in 2016 as the first of their
  Pascal architecture powered Tesla cards. The Tesla P100 came in PCIe and SXM
  versions and was the first GPU accelerator to use High Bandwidth Memory 2
  (HBM2). It did not have Tensor Cores, so it isn't usually preferred for
  machine learning. However, it's FP32 and FP16 FLOPs are still quite good.
