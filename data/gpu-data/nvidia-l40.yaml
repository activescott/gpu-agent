summary: The NVIDIA L40 GPU was introduced in September 2022 with part number
  900-2G133-0010-000. It is based on the AD102 chip from the Ada Lovelace
  architecture. It is optimized for graphics and AI-enabled 2D, video and 3D
  image generation. It uses the PCIe Gen4 x16 interconnect and Unlike the NVIDIA
  L4, it allows connecting monitors with 4x DisplayPort connectors.

  - "Estimated MSRP of $31,000 USD for the NVIDIA L40 based on OEM list prices. NVIDIA does not publish official MSRP for data center GPUs. OEM list prices corroborated by 2 independent sources: Lenovo ThinkSystem NVIDIA L40 (4X67A84823) has MSRP of $33,109 per lenovo.com, and Cisco UCSX-GPU-L40 has GPL list price of approximately $30,000 per itprice.com. The $31,000 estimate represents the midpoint of these OEM list prices. Note: Current market/resale prices (~$7,500) are significantly lower due to depreciation but do not reflect original launch list pricing."
