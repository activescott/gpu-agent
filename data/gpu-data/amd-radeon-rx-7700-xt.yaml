summary: >-
  The AMD Radeon RX 7700 XT was unveiled in August, 2023 as one of the GPUs
  using the new RDNA 3 architecture. It includes RDNA 3 architecture's new AI
  Accelerators which accelerate the GEMM operations that are critical to machine
  learning/AI performance. 
      With 54 compute units (CUs) and 108 AI Accelerators, it has lower compute capacity compared to the 7900 XTX's 96 CUs and 192 AI Accelerators, but the RDNA 3 architecture's AI Accelerators make it a contender among AMD GPUs for AI/machine learning.
      Some common models of this card are the Gigabyte GV-R77XTGAMING OC-12GD, ASRock RX7700XT CL 12GO / 90-GA4QZZ-00UANF, RX7700XT PG 12GO / 90-GA4LZZ-00UANF, RX7700XT SL 12GO / 90-GA4PZZ-00UANF, Asus TUF-RX7700XT-O12G-GAMING/90YV0JK0-M0NA00, PowerColor RX 7700 XT 12G-L/OC / RX7700XT 12GB-L/OC, Sapphire 11335-04-20G and 11335-03-20G, and XFX RX-77TQICKB9.   
      The lowest price is tracked and continuously updated across multiple sellers for all of these models below.
