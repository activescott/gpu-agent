summary: >-
  The AMD Radeon RX 7700 is a desktop gaming graphics card based on the RDNA 3 architecture
  using the Navi 32 GPU. Built on TSMC's 5nm process, it features 40 compute units with 2,560
  stream processors and 80 AI Accelerators (matrix cores) for enhanced AI/ML performance.
  The card includes 40 second-generation ray tracing accelerators and 16GB of GDDR6 memory
  on a 256-bit bus running at 19.4 Gbps, delivering 622.1 GB/s of bandwidth. With a boost
  clock of 2,600 MHz, it delivers 26.62 TFLOPS of FP32 performance. The RX 7700 has a TDP
  of 200W and requires a single 8-pin power connector. It features 64MB of Infinity Cache
  (L3) to boost effective memory bandwidth and supports DirectX 12 Ultimate with hardware-
  accelerated ray tracing and variable rate shading. The card uses a PCIe 4.0 x16 interface
  and is designed for high-performance 1440p and 4K gaming.

notes:
  - FP32 TFLOPS of 26.62 calculated as 2,560 stream processors × 2,600 MHz boost clock × 2 ops/cycle = 26.62 TFLOPS
  - FP16 performance is 53.25 TFLOPS calculated at 2:1 ratio to FP32, standard for RDNA 3 architecture
  - tensorCoreCount of 80 represents the AI Accelerators/matrix cores (2 per compute unit × 40 compute units)
  - Memory bandwidth calculated as 256-bit bus × 19.4 Gbps effective = 622.1 GB/s
  - RDNA 3 architecture includes dedicated AI Accelerators for machine learning workloads
  - Built on TSMC 5nm process with Navi 32 GPU die
  - Features 64MB of Infinity Cache (L3) in addition to 2MB L2 cache
  - Base clock of 1,900 MHz with boost to 2,600 MHz
  - MSRP of $350 is an estimated value. AMD did not announce an official MSRP when the RX 7700 was quietly added to AMD's product page on September 18, 2024. Tom's Hardware analysis suggested the card would need to be priced at ~$350 or less to avoid cannibalizing the lineup. As of December 2025, only ASRock has announced a Challenger model with no retail pricing disclosed. The card appears primarily in pre-built systems (e.g., CyberPowerPC) rather than standalone retail availability.
  - No official AMD OPN (Ordering Part Number) or other manufacturer identifiers were found in public documentation for the RX 7700. AMD does not typically publish OPNs for desktop consumer GPUs.
  - Only ASRock has announced an AIB partner product for the RX 7700 (non-XT) as of December 2025. Other major AIB partners (Sapphire, PowerColor, XFX, Gigabyte, ASUS, MSI) have not announced RX 7700 products, likely due to the card's limited retail availability and OEM/pre-built focus.
