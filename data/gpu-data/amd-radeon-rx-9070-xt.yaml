summary: |
  The AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT is a high-performance graphics card released in March 2025,
  featuring the RDNA 4 architecture based on the Navi 48 GPU. It offers 64 compute units
  with 4,096 stream processors, 128 2nd-generation AI Accelerators, and 16GB of GDDR6 memory
  running at 20 Gbps. The card is designed for high-refresh 1440p and 4K gaming, providing
  exceptional performance with a boost clock reaching 3.1 GHz in factory-overclocked models.
  With a TDP of 304W, it delivers 48.7 TFLOPS of FP32 compute performance. The RX 9070 XT
  features 64MB of 3rd-generation Infinity Cache, 64 3rd-generation Ray Tracing accelerators,
  and supports FSR 4 (FidelityFX Super Resolution 4), AMD's machine-learning upscaling
  solution exclusive to RDNA 4. Built on TSMC's 4nm process using the Navi 48 XTX die,
  the card is positioned to compete with NVIDIA's RTX 4070 Ti and RTX 5070 at a starting
  price of $599. It uses a PCIe 5.0 x16 interface and offers 640 GB/s memory bandwidth
  on a 256-bit bus.

notes:
  - tensorCoreCount tracks the 2nd-generation AI Accelerators as "tensor cores". The RX 9070 XT has 128 AI Accelerators (2 per CU × 64 CUs).
  - fp32TFLOPS of 48.7 calculated based on 4,096 stream processors × 2.97 GHz boost clock × 2 (dual-issue) = 48.66 TFLOPS, rounded to 48.7 TFLOPS as reported by AMD.
  - fp16TFLOPS of 97.4 represents 2x FP32 performance due to packed FP16 operations support in RDNA 4.
  - Memory bandwidth calculated as 256-bit interface × 20 Gbps = 640 GB/s, enhanced by 64MB 3rd-generation Infinity Cache.
  - TDP is 304W, with some custom models featuring up to 330W power limits.
  - Process node is TSMC 4nm with Navi 48 XTX GPU die.
  - Clock speeds vary by model - reference specs show 2,400 MHz game clock and 2,970 MHz boost, while factory-overclocked models like XFX Mercury reach 3,100 MHz boost.
  - RDNA 4 introduces optimized Compute Units, 3rd-generation Ray Tracing accelerators, and 2nd-generation AI Accelerators.
  - FSR 4 is exclusive to RDNA 4 GPUs and leverages the AI accelerators for ML-based upscaling.
  - The RX 9070 XT competes directly with NVIDIA's RTX 4070 Ti and RTX 5070, offering competitive performance at a more attractive price point.
  - MSRP of $599 USD sourced from AMD official announcement per GSMArena and Tom's Hardware coverage.
