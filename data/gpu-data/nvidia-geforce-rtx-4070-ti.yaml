summary: |
  The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti is a graphics card released in 2022,
  featuring the Ada Lovelace architecture based on the AD104 GPU. The set of
  retail cards in the NVIDIA RTX 40-series cards is RTX 4090, RTX 4080 SUPER,
  RTX 4080, RTX 4070 Ti SUPER, RTX 4070 Ti, RTX 4070 SUPER, RTX 4070, RTX 4060
  Ti, and the RTX 4060. The NVIDIA L40 GPU and L4 GPUs are also based on the
  same Ada Architecture aimed at the data center. While primarily aimed at
  gamers, the RTX 40-series offers strong capabilities for machine learning
  tasks, particularly inference and training workloads that benefit from its
  large memory and high core count. It uses a PCI-Express 4.0 x16 host
  interface.

notes:
  - MSRP of $799 USD verified from multiple credible sources. Note that no Founders Edition was released for the RTX 4070 Ti (partner cards only). This GPU was originally planned as the RTX 4080 12GB at $899 but was "unlaunched" after controversy and re-released as the RTX 4070 Ti at $799.
  - fp16TFLOPS is "Peak FP16 Tensor TFLOPS with FP16 Accumulate" as that's what NVIDIA publishes. Using the "with sparsity" metric.
  - 'int8TOPS of 320.7 represents non-sparse (dense) INT8 performance, derived from sparse INT8 of 641.4 TOPS ÷ 2 per NVIDIA Ada architecture whitepaper. With 2:4 structured sparsity, INT8 performance is 641.4 TOPS. Dense value used for consistent cross-vendor comparison.'
  - Power based on what NVIDIA refers to as "TGP (Total Graphics Power)"
  - "Manufacturer identifiers: Board ID PG141 with SKU 331 confirmed from TechPowerUp GPU Database and GCC Gamers. GPU variant is AD104-400-A1 based on Ada Lovelace architecture. Note: NVIDIA did not release a Founders Edition for RTX 4070 Ti, so no official NVPN exists for a reference design - all cards are AIB partner models."
  - "Third-party products: ASUS offers four models - two ROG STRIX variants (standard ROG-STRIX-RTX4070TI-12G-GAMING and OC Edition ROG-STRIX-RTX4070TI-O12G-GAMING) and two TUF Gaming variants (standard TUF-RTX4070TI-12G-GAMING and OC Edition TUF-RTX4070TI-O12G-GAMING). Model numbers sourced from official ASUS product pages."
  - "MSI model numbers sourced from official MSI product pages - includes SUPRIM X 12G and GAMING X TRIO 12G variants."
  - "Gigabyte model numbers sourced from official Gigabyte product pages and TechPowerUp - GV-N407TEAGLE-OC-12GD (Eagle OC) and GV-N407TGAMING OC-12GD (Gaming OC)."
  - "PNY part number VCG4070T12TFXXPB1-O sourced from TechPowerUp GPU Database and official PNY product page for the XLR8 Gaming VERTO EPIC-X RGB Triple Fan variant."
  - "Zotac part numbers sourced from official Zotac product pages - ZT-D40710D-10P (Trinity standard) and ZT-D40710J-10P (Trinity OC)."
